<h1>Is this trade guaranteed to make money? need help !?</h1>
<div class="answer">I found a correlation between GLD ( gold etf) today and the price of gold in 1976. The prices line up exactly. The chart indicates that gold will head down to 1080 and reverse back to 1700 range. Here is a picture of the chart

The blue is the price today and the orange is the price in 1976

</script><p> It is an interesting comparison and I hope it proceeds as the older chart shows...but no guarantees <br>
 <br>
I would be careful about investing in GLD. Most people think this ETF is backed by physical gold. But apparently that might not be the case anymore and som people are commenting on this, <br>
 <br>
this is an interesting commentary on gold inventories <br>
 <br>

 <br>
in the latest version of the blog it says <br>
 <br>

 <br>
Friday,  the GLD reported another loss  in inventory equal to 3.01 tonnes of gold. On Thursday,  5.71 tonnes disappeared which followed Wednesday&#039;s liquidation of 4.52 tonnes of gold. <br>
 <br>
The registered  vaults at the GLD will eventually become a crime scene as real physical gold  departs for eastern shores leaving behind paper obligations to the remaining shareholders.  As you can see, the bleeding of physical gold from this locale continues unabated. There is no doubt in my mind that GLD has nowhere near the gold that say they have and this will eventually lead to the default at the LBMA and then onto the comex in a heartbeat  (same banks) <br>

 <br>
This EFT is advertised as a physically gold backed ETF <br>

 <br>
there is confirmation of the ETF dumping Gold in this link too , however they offer reasons for it happening. <br>

 <br>
I am not sure who to believe at this point...but I would be cautious

</script><p> No i suggest sticking to physical gold. ETFs are notorious to rip off money and sometimes go bankrupt
        </p> No the time period is too far apart. 37 years
        </p> It is just coincidence. No it is not guaranteed. It seems a good bet, though!
