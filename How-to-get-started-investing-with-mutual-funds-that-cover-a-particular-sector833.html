<h1>How to get started investing with mutual funds that cover a particular sector?</h1>
<div class="answer">I want to get started investing soon. I graduate college in 2 years. I heard mutual funds are the best way to go right now. However I don&amp;#39;t even know how to get started or where to start. I was thinking I can start at etrade*** and buy a few mutual funds and add money to them over time when I can until I start working full time. 

Can I buy sector mutual funds on etrade? If so I want to buy a mutual fund that covers a wide variety of the technology sector and renewable energy sector. 

However I can&amp;#39;t find a list of mutual funds of those sectors to look at. Are those mutual funds only unique to etrade or is there overall well known mutual funds to look at?

I&amp;#39;m clueless, I could use some guidance. Thanks!<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> A brokerage account may not be the best thing for you.  Generally, you&#039;ll have to pay brokerage fees each time you buy or redeem mutual fund shares.  Pick a good mutual fund company like Vanguard or T. Rowe Price and buy the funds directly from them with no fees.  Both of those have many fund choices, including equity sector funds.

</script><p> E-trade you can always buy ETF&#039;s which are mutual funds that trade like stocks.  My favorite play is Vanguard however also look into Wisdomtree, Rydex.  Vanguard does have a tech ETF called Vanguard Information Technology with core holdings in Microsoft, Apple, IBM, Cisco Systems, Google, Intel, HP, etc.  It&#039;s a rock solid tech fund with an expense ratio of only .25%. <br>
 <br>
Stay away for renewable energy and just go with an all purpose energy fund.  With oil prices dropping recently it will be harder to make money in solar, wind, etc.  Good luck!
        </p> Like some others here, I&#039;m not a big fan of doing mutual funds through brokerage accounts.  I prefer to deal directly with the funds themselves. <br>
 <br>
My favorite fund families are Vanguard, Fidelity, and T. Rowe Price - all have a great selection of funds (including sector funds), low fees, and excellent customer service. <br>
 <br>
To my knowledge there are no funds that invest exclusively in renewable energy - most energy funds invest in ALL types of energy, including renewables. <br>
 <br>
Here are some funds that might interest you in each of these families: <br>
 <br>
VANGUARD: Energy Fund (VGENX); they do not have a technology fund <br>
 <br>
FIDELITY: Select Computers (FDCPX); Select Materials (FSDPX); Select Software &amp; Computer Services (FSCSX); Select Technology (FSPTX);  <br>
 <br>
T. ROWE PRICE: Media &amp; Telecomm (PRMTX); New Era [Energy/Natural Resources] (PRNEX); Science &amp; Technology (PRSCX) <br>
 <br>
I hope that helps.  Good luck!
        </p> One thing is for sure: people will get sick. The baby boomers are getting old, and will need medical care. GenX&#039;s kids will need medical care. Big Pharma isn&#039;t going under anytime soon, so it&#039;s probably a safe investment as long as it&#039;s a mutual fund. I wouldn&#039;t take a chance on a single company right now, because there have been too many times that drugs were proved to be dangerous and the stock took a big hit.
        </p> Google &quot;renewable energy mutual funds&quot; and see what comes up. Tech funds are pretty common, but Google that as well. Also substitute ETF for mutual fund just to see if anything different pops up. <br>
 <br>
I would personally not invest in renewable energy right now, unless it was in geothermal companies like Waterfurnace, or in wind I would go with GE.
        </p> yes you can buy mutual funds on etrade. <br>
i suggest you go to the library or bookstore and read up on them beforehand and educate yourself. learn about load vs. no-load funds, sector etf&#039;s, managament fees...etc. suzy orman is also a good resource. etrade salespeople are just that....salespeople...so theyre only gonna steer you into the mutual funds that offer the hghest commssion for themselves.  <br>
if youre buying a car youre gonna do a ton of research right? so do yourself a favor and do the same for your investments. <br>
 <br>
cheers
