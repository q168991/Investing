<h1>Learning about investing in the stock market?</h1>
<div class="answer">Hi, I would like to learn about investing in the stock market. I am 20 years old and have nooooo idea about it, but it seems it&amp;#39;s a great way to make money if you know what you&amp;#39;re doing.

Where can I learn everything that I need to know to be successful? From the absolute basics. Any good books/websites to start with? Then intermediate stuff to move on to?

By the way I&amp;#39;m not looking for a quick run through that will get me up and running in a few days. I&amp;#39;m happy to spend as much time as it takes to learn, whether that&amp;#39;s a year or ten.

Thanks
Mike<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Mike,  <br>
 <br>
I have 20 years experience in the markets, and I started learning in college. <br>
 <br>
I had only 1 investment class. Yes, got an A.  <br>
 <br>
I would: <br>
 <br>
1. Watch/ listen to CNBC as much as you can. Ignore all the fund managers and investment advisers who are always bullish regardless of the market. CNBC Fast Money is a good show. <br>
 <br>
2. I would go over my post history where I have address over 4,000 answered question, but also have over 100 &quot;starred questions&quot; to highlight points and market history as it related to the market at the time. <br>
 <br>
I spent a lot of time learning from veteran traders, and experts so I would encourage the same. I still learn and follow other experts. one can&#039;t know everything. As we say in the brokerage business, &quot;one does not have a monopoly on ideas.&quot; <br>
 <br>
3. I would read on-line top financial news daily: <br>
Examples: <br>
Reuters <br>
http://***reuters***/finance <br>
 <br>
Wall Street Journal <br>
http://online.wsj***/home-page <br>
 <br>
Barron&#039;s <br>
http://online.barrons***/home-page <br>
 <br>
Yahoo Finance <br>
http://finance.yahoo***/ <br>
 <br>
4. I would read about market history. Including why markets crash. <br>
http://answers.yahoo***/question/index;_ylt=ApHn2SZKm3bSEfwwY2uToyDsy6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20090501122414AAB9qbU&amp;show=7#profile-info-56ajrOwWaa <br>
 <br>
5. I would learn the basics of Fundamental and Technical Analysis (see the following post for links). <br>
http://answers.yahoo***/question/index;_ylt=AlHP70Uz.lc628toO6UdOw7ty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20080318121406AAt03x5&amp;show=7#profile-info-XrF9qxG7aa <br>
 <br>
6. I think all people need to clearly understand this: <br>
Subprime mortgage crisis? <br>
http://answers.yahoo***/question/index?qid=20090313011015AAhf7YV&amp;r=w#BaN_M2D0AnhGUqjJm65y <br>
 <br>
Why do mortgages interest rates change? <br>

 <br>
Why would easing interest rates by the Fed help housing? Why it&#039;s in trouble in the first place isn&#039;t it? <br>

 <br>
On Housing - economy <br>

 <br>
(note the dates of these posts). <br>
 <br>
7. Understand Retirement Accounts <br>
Should I open a Roth IRA or just an IRA? <br>
http://answers.yahoo***/question/index;_ylt=AsnUXN0g6HSkPbxUymoO4GPty6IX;_ylv=3?qid=20080603121941AAMN0bP&amp;show=7#profile-info-RtfCGOtNaa <br>
 <br>
8. Figure out your basic risk tolerance. <br>

  <br>
Good Luck!

</script><p> I was in the same position as you: 20 years old and knowing nothing about the stock market.  The best way I learned about the stock market and related topics in personal finance are reading really good financial books and blogs.  I find if you keep reading (even if they seem repetitive), the things start to stick in your mind.  Now, 3 years later, I&#039;m halfway through completing my Certificate for Personal Financial Planning.   <br>
 <br>
A few of my favorites blogs are (you can search for the actual sites with Google) Get Rich Slowly, the Simple Dollar, Generation X Finance, and Five Cent Nickel.  Also, look up the Carnival of Investing which is a weekly roundup of interesting investing blog posts and you can find a lot of great blogs from there.   <br>
 <br>
A lot of these blogs also have articles reviewing good (or bad) investing books so that should give you a great head start!
        </p> Playing the stock market is like playing poker...you not only play your cards, you play the other players at the table. Many lousy company&#039;s stock skyrocket because of investor/analyst hype. Many great compay&#039;s stock go nowhere because the company/industry is &quot;boring&quot; to the hyping market makets. To make $$$ in the market, get in on the leading edge of the hype &amp; sell when all newswires and analysts love the stock because soon this stock will crash when the anaysts and marketmakers start to court the next stock. In other words, the stock market is not a numbers game, it&#039;s game of reading human nature.
        </p> What I did, was read a bit about investing...starting with one of those &quot;dummies&quot; books and moving up to a bit more advanced. <br>
 <br>
I then set up a notebook for research on various stocks identified in stock screener programs, upgrades, and strong buy ratings, etc. <br>
 <br>
Then I set up a phony portfolio of my own (you can use MSN stock tracker or do up your own spreadsheet) and made fake trades using my research.  I kept track of how often I scored and so on, compared what I expected a stock to do and what it did, etc. <br>
 <br>
In the end I did this for about 2 years before I was comfortable enough to start with real money.
        </p> Whether you are just beginning to save or already have a nest egg for retirement, your money should be working as efficiently and diligently for you as you did to earn it. To succeed in this, however, it is important to start with a solid of understanding of how stock-market investment works.   <br>

Spend as much time as you can reading about the stock market and economy. Listen to the insights and predictions of experts to develop a sense of the state of the economy and what types of stocks are performing well.
        </p> As much as I hate his advice on individual stocks, Jim Cramer has two EXCELLENT books for people looking to learn about the stock market.  Pick up a copy for Real Money and Stay Mad for Life.
        </p> I&#039;m 16, in economics class.. <br>
 <br>
This is what you do. You buy stock when price is low, and sell when price is high.  <br>
 <br>
Example. <br>
 <br>
Don&#039;t buy when the number is green, buy when its red. <br>
 <br>
Sell when the Number is green. <br>
 <br>

If you want a monthly check, then buy stocks with Dividends
