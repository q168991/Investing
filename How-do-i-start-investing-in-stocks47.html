<h1>How do i start investing in stocks?</h1>
<div class="answer">I want to start investing in stocks, but i have no idea how to. I heard its good money, but i don&amp;#39;t understand where i need to go to start trading stocks, and how old does one have to be to make an account for investing in stocks. Also could you explain to me what a mutual fund is and the basics of investing in stocks? Thank You.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> To invest in stocks all you need to do is: <br>
a) Be 18 (if under 18 then you need your parents to cosign) <br>
b) Talk to a stock broker to invest your money <br>
c) Have money to invest <br>
 <br>
And that&#039;s it, but that doesn&#039;t mean you will make money in the stock market. In this case I will assume you want to make money so there are extra steps that need to be taken. <br>
 <br>
To make money from stocks you need to: <br>
a) Find a company that is either starting out or is in an economic slump <br>
    -the stock prices should be low at that time <br>
    -a good example is Ford way back during the economic crisis and stocks were under $2 <br>
b) Research the company <br>
    -who is the ceo? <br>
    -does the ceo have experience with running a business? <br>
    -how good is the companies business plan? <br>
    -will the company thrive or go under? <br>
    -these are some good questions to ask. When I bought my Ford stock, I knew the government wasn&#039;t going to let Ford go out of business and I researched and saw that the new ceo that was put in charge was put in situations like this before and saved companies from going out of business. <br>
c) Decide how much you will invest <br>
    -how much can you afford to lose? <br>
    -how strongly do you believe in the company? <br>
d) Talk to a stock broker <br>
    -fees will be charged with investing in stocks <br>
    -the lower the fees, the more you can invest <br>
e) Watch the stock market and check your stock price every day <br>
    -when you buy at a low price, you can sell at a high price for bigger profits <br>
    -don&#039;t gamble for the jackpot! earlier this year, I could have sold my Ford stock for $18 share making a big profit considering i bought the stock at $2 a share and invested $1,000 for 500 shares. I was going to wait for it to hit $20 a share but it dropped quickly to $14 a share and now it is less than $10 because of the crisis in Europe and the amount of Ford cars sold there dropped. <br>
f) If everything was done correctly, talk to your stock broker to withdraw your money into your savings account. <br>
    -this is where you make your money <br>
g) If things look like they are headed in a bad direction and your company might go out of business, talk to your stock broker quick and with draw your money before you lose all of it! <br>
    -when things settle out at a lower price you can re-invest if you think the company might recover. <br>
 <br>

Never invest more what you have. <br>
No over trading <br>
Never follow any tips research your self or follow any one person.
        </p> You&#039;re right, investing in stock can make you a lot of money if you&#039;re careful.  I&#039;ll walk you through how to do it. <br>
 <br>
1. First, choose your stock.  I suggest you go online and look up some stocks.  Find a few that sound promising, then make sure you research them thoroughly.  (I&#039;ve got a hunch that all kinds of green technology is going to blow up in the next few years, so I&#039;d start there.) <br>
 <br>
2. Find a stockbroker.  Your bank might operate as your stockbroker, or you could look up a stockbroking company. <br>
 <br>
3. Tell your stockbroker what stock you want to buy.  He/she may give you some advice; you should take that advice into consideration.  Once you&#039;re absolutely sure you want to buy that stock, tell him/her.  Then you&#039;ve bought stock. <br>
 <br>
You can be any age to buy stock.  Also, a mutual fund is where a lot of people pool in their money to invest.

        </p> How can you cash in on the potential growth that penny stocks have to offer? Learn here https://tr.im/learnpennystock  <br>
 <br>
There are three things you&#039;ll want to look for when picking a penny stock to make sure that you don&#039;t get penny stuck: Underlying business, financials, and footnotes. <br>
 <br>
When it comes to penny stocks, a company&#039;s underlying business is even more important than it is in exchange-traded stocks. That&#039;s because the penny stock world is home to &quot;shell&quot; companies that are legally incorporated, but don&#039;t have any business operations
        </p> Understand to stock market is very difficult for beginner you should start with large cap stock never predict market just invest and when you get more than 20% profit take it.
        </p> This economy is going to suck for awhile. Possibly if we come out of this without our dollar going flat over a long period you may come out. But with technology today and the institutions and so many influences in the markets you could be robbed of your money real quick. You may want to buy gold coins and if your addiment about stocks the only industry that should be growing is energy for the next ten + years. Unless our govt and elected officials feel its better that we continue to buy our energy needs from other countrys at the tune of 700 billion a year.
        </p> Before you do anything get a book on Investing For Dummies and that will be a good start.  Don&#039;t just jump in without any background.  You will make mistakes if you do.

         Go to your local library and borrow a few books on the basics of investing.  This  will give you a good and free education. <br>
 <br>
Be well educated before you try to enter the market.  Novices usually lose money to the old professionals who have been doing trading for many years and have all the tricks of the trade at their control.
        </p> Trading binary options online is not as complicated as many people think it is. Read here https://tr.im/TroUR <br>
 <br>
You don’t have to be an economics expert in order to make money by trading binary options. The charts allow you to predict the future course of an asset by finding patterns in its past price movements, and after all this what we need to win a binary trade. <br>
 <br>
Don&#039;t be intimidated by the charts, actually they are not that hard to read and understand. Strategies that are based on reading and analyzing charts are part of the technical analysis area.
        </p> Mutual fund is better way to invest in stock market for new comers.
