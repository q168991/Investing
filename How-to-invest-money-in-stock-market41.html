</script><p> First, I want to say that if you are new for stock market then daily trading is not good for you. Invest for a long term basis. It will be good for you and is less risky. Apart from website, business magazine is also good to understand the strategy of market. However, from a stock site its good to earn daily news and to know which fund will give you profit in the near future.
        </p> Most of the time I am telling people not to get lured towards day trading just because you think its a easy way to earn money, when its not. Secondly, you want to Invest money in Stock Market, doing day trade is not what you may call Investment in stock market. <br>
 <br>
If you really want to earn money investing in stocks, delivery/swing positional trading or SIP is the way to go. Do not trade on free day trading tips provided all over the web and on your Mobile as SMS from copy/paste freelancers. <br>

        </p> Dear arun, <br>
 <br>
              donot invest in share market if you not have a knowledge about share market , my advise will be invest in share market through mutual fund, it is because investing in a share market is a very tough work , we should to keep grate eyes on a perticular share and on current news also we all are working person we have not so much time to do that job , so solution is invest in muutal fund through SIP (systamatic investmant plan) in it, a particular amount will be invest automatically from your saving account (monthly) , by that amount will be well perfossinal fund manager will invest in share market , they will not take any fees from you , but if you take out money before one year they will take 1-2% of current value of fund. i got 2000rs in a year of 1000 per month sip from HDFC TOP 200 fund.
        </p> You will learn a lot through virtual trading and trading games. The best one is WSS and have a load of free resources and tutorials available.  <br>
 <br>
It is a good way to learn and if you participate in the games you can win prizes so it adds an extra touch of realism.
