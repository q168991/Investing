</script><p> Gold and Silver are commodities which can be traded as commodities or you can invest in these via ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds). Also, you should first decide whether you want to invest in funds which hold the equivalent amount of investment in the physical product i.e. if you buy $2000 worth of funds, there is a corresponding physical amount of gold/silver somewhere in the world which this fund is holding or whether it is investing in companies that do the mining of these commodities. <br>
 <br>
This requires a little more research. Hopefully the resources below will help. <br>

</script><p> Hey John, please call Devon Dennie at 786-715-8075. He is working directly with Silver and Gold investments. Please say Jasmin refered you. Alot of people are currently shifting their investment portfolios from bonds and stocks to intangible metals. I believe the Silver value especially is on an enormous rise and nothing right now is any safer than precious metals. <br>
 <br>
Good luck.
