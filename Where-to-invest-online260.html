</script><p> There are quite a few online investing companies.  I&#039;d have to say the most popular are... <br>
 <br>
***etrade*** <br>
***tdameritrade*** <br>
***scottrade*** <br>
***charlesschwab*** <br>
 <br>
E*trade is really heavy on the extra&#039;s, if you need it, they&#039;ve got it: performance ratings reports (buy/hold/sell) by a variety of popular ratings services, excellent charts, news, special order types, and a free real time quotes system that is live during market hours.  They also have relatively low commissions 12.99 - 9.99 depending on how much you trade but if you don&#039;t trade at least once a quarter or have a total account balance above $10,000 than you could get dinged with a $40 inactivity fee. <br>
 <br>
If you&#039;re not worried about services like the ones listed above you can trade with scottrade for $7 a trade &amp; no inactivity fees.  Unfortunately you&#039;ll have to get your market information elsewhere like yahoo finance and you&#039;ll be getting quotes that are delayed from the market 20 minutes.  Scottrade also offers some walk in centers. <br>
 <br>
Schwab is somewhere inbetween E*Trade &amp; Scottrade but it&#039;s main benefit is the walk in centers.  it&#039;s commissions ($12.95) are comparable to E*Trade but the online services don&#039;t compare.  It says it doesn&#039;t have an inactivity fee, however if you get in to the fine print, THEY ACTALLY DO... Accounts under $10,000 and have less than 8 trades in the last year get a $12.50 fee.   <br>
 <br>
Ameritrade is tries to catch up with E*Trade on serivices but cannot.  They have a more affordable comission at $9.99 a trade, but the services you get with E*Trade make that extra $3 worth it.  If they have an inactivity fee than it&#039;s damn hard to find, but it doesn&#039;t say that they don&#039;t which is suspicious.

</script><p> The safety of your money (and its potential return) depends on what you invest in. Basically, the safest places to put your money would be government-backed bonds (T-Bills, for example) or a bank&#039;s money market account. Barring a total collapse of the federal government, these are pretty much safe. You should look for an APY (annual percentage yield) of 4% or more in this case. Stocks offer a higher potential return but more risk. It is entirely possible (though perhaps not likely) to lose a significant portion of your investment. The best way to guard against the risk of losing money is to diversify into many different holdings, although this is difficult with only $100. I would also say that the broad American stock market is not poised to return much at the moment, so you may wish to stay out of this area. Another area that is receiving a lot of attention is the commodities sector. Commodities can be just about any raw material, but the commodities with the most attention now are probably oil, natural gas, and gold. While it has previously been difficult to invest in these, the advent of ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) allow you to trade certain commodities just like stocks. You can invest in gold under the ticker symbol GLD and oil under the ticker symbol USO. I think that this area (and bonds) are probably the best areas to invest in over the next few years. Keep in mind that if you invest online, the fees are likely to be an incredibly high percentage of your initial investment. The least expensive online stock brokers charge around $4 to $7 per trade, which means that fees will make up a higher percentage of your initial investment if it is low ($100) than if it&#039;s higher ($1,000 to $10,000 or more).
        </p> I use ShareBuilder***.  They only charge $4 per investment (there are other plans available) and there isn&#039;t a set limit as to how much to invest.

Hope it helps <br>
