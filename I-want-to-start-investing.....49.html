</script><p> Venkat ve not mentioned what is your kitty, its very good to hear that at this age you want to start investing. and just splurge the money. I would suggest you start a monthly SIP in a good Mutual fund scheme e.g. ; HDFC Top200 Fund. for the amount which you may be able to save each month. <br>
Direct Equity investment at your age is a No-No, as it is very difficult to maintain the profitable investements for a longer time, rather not many shares are there which will give good returns for each year for very long. And even if accidentely bump in one, then your broker will not keep you invested for any scrip for long, as you have to remember, he will only earn when you buy or sell. Not when your scrip doubles or tripples.  <br>
This may seem to be boring, but it is fact of Life,but sorry to be very advisory <br>
I understand that you are still studying, as you said that u are an undergraduate STUDENT. Also u want to secure your future, with best of my knowledge I would advice that the Most IMP thing to invest in your age is TIME in the best avenue possible, that is CAREER, So Invest in Mutual Funds, save time, Invest in big companies in whatever small form you want,and Hire big Fund managers for very small salary (fund mgmt fee). You do your job best they will do theirs best. <br>
Stock Investments are very risky and volatile, they are best done on one&#039;s HARD Earned Money, else mistakes are repeated. Anyways if anybody was sure how the markets will move tommorow, then there would not be any markets needed, People knowing would have purchased or sold the world yesterday only.

</script><p> Be very careful investing with a financial adviser. If the advisers in India are anything like those in the UK then they are pushed hard to make sales and will place your money where it makes most commission for them.  <br>
 <br>
General principles of investment advice: <br>
 <br>
Always pay off your debts before you invest. The interest you receive on your investment is generally less than you pay on your debts.  <br>
 <br>
Make sure that you always have access to an emergency fund. You never know when your roof will start leaking or you may have to pay for medical treatment. If you place your money into a product that allows instant access you will not get a very good investment return. The equivalent of a few months salary should be enough.   <br>
 <br>
Next, start making plans for your retirement. I know this sounds odd when you&#039;re young. <br>
 <br>
Look at other tax efficient savings &amp; investments. These investments to not attract tax and this gives them an advantage over other tax bearing products and often enables them to pay more returns to the investor. See the attached link for examples of tax efficient products in India.  <br>
 <br>
Consider tying your money up for short periods. If you don&#039;t need access to money for one year then they will pay you more interest - if you can wait two years then they&#039;ll pay even more. A word of warning - be careful about tying your money up for too long - as an undergraduate, your life will probably change more over the next ten years than at any other time.  <br>
 <br>
Those were some textbook principles but I&#039;ll add one more. Consider investing in something that you love - like your house or your education - they are rewarding in a more immediate way and are sometimes financially rewarding too. This is what I do.  <br>
 <br>
Good luck. <br>
 <br>
EDIT: Never invest in anything that talks about 25-30% a year!
        </p> Now that you are flooded with so many answers of all types, you must be thinking if securing future via investing is really an easy thing to do .. Isn&#039;t it? But actually its not that easy and most of people actually kills there future instead of securing it while Investing or trading in stocks. <br>
 <br>
I would first advice you read as much as you can and understand the basics. To start investing, systematic investment (SIP) in Mutual Funds is the safest way to began. You may find reading one of article informative to know better what all I am talking about. <br>
 <br>
http://***winfromus***/education-learn-and-earn/where-to-invest-mutual-funds-or-fixed-deposits/
        </p> Well that good you want to invest at the early age. It helps to build good corpus for the retired life. <br>
 <br>
Before investing, i advice you to first what kind of investor you are (conservative or aggressive. <br>
 <br>
If your conservative than invest in FD or debts funds which gives you less returns but relative safer. <br>
 <br>
If you are aaggressivethan invest in Mutual funds, shares or Managed forex funds, this gives you good returns but are risky also. but over long time they give decent returns even 25% to 30% annually also. <br>
 <br>
I am saying this through personal experience as i am managing funds through a good broker in Managed forex funds and got a decent returns over 2 years (i invested in 2009). Say around 24% returns. <br>
 <br>
If you wish to know more, add me i would glad to share.
        </p> first of all make yourself a list on how much you are willing to risk, what do you want to trade with (forex/ commodities etc) and then look for different brokers and see what they are offering. Here is a directory where you can find different forex-brokers: http://***forexpros***/brokers/ <br>
After that I would suggest you try demo accounts the brokers you have chosen offer and see if it could work for you. You can find a list of free demo&#039;s here: http://***forexpros***/brokers/forex-demo-accounts <br>
Also, read all kind of educational articles  about trading, you can find plenty of them online, plus ask in forex forums.  <br>
Good luck
