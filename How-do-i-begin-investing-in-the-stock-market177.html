<h1>How do i begin investing in the stock market?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am interested in investing some money i have recently come into as a kind of &amp;#39;retirement planning&amp;#39; - it isn&amp;#39;t much but i figure if i start now it will mature in the long term; but here is my problem; i know nothing of investments or shares or the stock market. my knowledge of finance is slight at best and I have no idea where to begin researching. 

please can someone point me in the right direction and provide some clues as to what kind of specific knowledge i should seek?

many thanks.

</script><p> An introductory book like _Stock Markets for Dummies_ is a good place to start.  This will give you a basic explanation of most things there are to know about the mechanics of stock investing including useful websites to surf and full-service vs. self-directed brokerages. <br>
 <br>
Investors Business Daily (IBD) is a solid daily resource (and its complement, ***investors*** ). It&#039;s a better newspaper than the Wall Street Journal and it is built around a particular approach to trading. You could read _How to Make Money in Stocks_ by William O&#039;Neil too--he&#039;s the founder of IBD.  <br>
 <br>
Search your local library for other books on stock investing. Try to absorb as much knowledge and understanding as you can.   <br>
 <br>
After you have extensively researched and gained a solid foundation/education then look to open a brokerage account and paper trade--this is trading with play money before you put real capital at risk.  You should do extensively before you eventually place your first trade live.  Your early live trades should be with a very small position size.  Only increase position size when you have done well to limit losses when the market has turned against you.

        </p> You see penny stocks are high velocity, fast move, fast paced investments that you don’t typically hang onto for a long period of time. Understand how simple it is to make money with penny stocks https://tr.im/7T2GQ <br>
 <br>
There are exceptions of course. Sometimes you will find some long-term trades that pay off big! Other times you will get into what are known as swing trades and those can really pay off as well. Most of the time though, profitable penny stock trading is all about the short game.  <br>
 <br>
In most cases you will buy and sell the same stock within a week. I’m not talking about day-trading which you may have heard about before. That’s a completely different game with a different set of rules. (It’s also a bit more risky.)
        </p> Play stock simulation games on sites such as investopedia. Investopedia is also like a investment dictionary so you will find everything from A to Z in stocks. It will take time and you might feel frustration at the beginning but you will get there. just have patience and keep reading articles on investopedia. <br>
Once you feel confident enough to trade, open scottrade account and start with minimum $500 account, if you do good, deposit money that you feel comfortable with.
        </p> Binary trading is notoriously risky but if you follow a special method I&#039;ve learned you can earn good money at almost no risk. This is the site I use: ( http://forexsignal.kyma.info ) I definitely recommend subscribing to this site in particular. I was a bit weary of binary trading from all the bad hype they receive but this site is pretty legit. This course explain everything you need to start a very profitable trading activity. Remember never invest 100% of your capital into any one security and never have 100% of your capital invested and a good understanding of the rules
        </p> Best advice is &quot;stay away from the stock market&quot; ;) <br>
 <br>
The markets are VERY volatile at the moment, and you&#039;re just as likely to lose the lot as make any worthwhile gains. <br>
 <br>
Speak to an independent financial adviser and ask him to give you some choices. <br>
He will charge you for the service, but he should be able to advise you of ways to make some gain from your investment.
        </p> You open a No Load Mutual Fund Account with a Brokerage such as Charles Schwab. <br>
No load means there are not numerous management charges.   This is where you money sits and grows slowly while you research and study investments.   <br>
All colleges and many libraries offer FREE financial planning seminars.  Find one locally and attend. <br>
Borrow a Suze Orman book from the Library.  She has written many and quite a few are for young adults just starting to learn
        </p> Binaries are simple to trade but don&#039;t make the mistake of thinking that they are easy to make money with. Learn here https://tr.im/zgZFS <br>
 <br>
To start, let&#039;s be clear: you can make money binary options trading. It&#039;s definitely possible to generate a consistent profit. Smart traders do it every day. In a modern marketplace that relies on leverage Roger Pierce will teach you not only how to utilise the most effective low risk spread strategy, but how to keep your savings growing using the same technique.
        </p> Read a stocks 101 book, they are plenty at your local library, I myself read some when i first started out. You should also save a webpage called morningstar*** to your favorite webpages, there they give you all the definitions that you will need for the different ratios. Then you should look into eshare*** or one of the other online trading websites to begin trading.
        </p> Investment in the stock market is not good idea.

         In stock market knowledge is not important your attitude and strategies is more important for earn money most of people have good knowledge but they have no patience because of that they trade more like over trading and at panic they sell their stock in loss and market turn bull run. <br>
 <br>
I hope you understand that most important is not knowledge but patience in stock market.
        </p> A stockbroker&#039;s  once told me he doesn&#039;t invest in Stocks and Shares! He just takes his commission. <br>
I agree with him.
