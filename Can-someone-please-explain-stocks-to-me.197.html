</script><p> Hi,  stocks are basically shares in a company.  If a company has a million shares of ten pounds each, then the value (market capitalisation) of the company = 10 X 1,000,000 = 10 millions pounds. <br>
 <br>
When you buy shares you are buying part of the worth of the company, usually a minute part eg 500 shares out of the million means you hold 500 divide by million = 0.05% of the company.  Bigger investors eg directors may own 1/4 or 1/2 the company by holding 250,000 or 500, 000 shares, respectively, in this example. <br>
 <br>
The value os shares is mainly determined by the investor senfiment at  a particular time which is basically supply and demand.  When more people are buying, the price rises and vice versa. <br>
 <br>
Many factors determine whether people buy or sell.  eg general financial state, the recommendations of analysts, reports of the company [whether good or bad], adverse markt conditions, interest rates [high interest rates mean people can get a decent rate in a building society, so they do not buy shares, therefore share prices fall: look out at news on Wed 31st and Thu 1st as there is a US Federal Reserve interest rate decision at about 6 pm on Wed], world catastrophes such as 9/11, etc. <br>
 <br>
Remember, the UK share market is a mirror of the US Dow Jones.  If the Americans sneeze, UK gets a cold!!! <br>
 <br>
If you are seriously interested, locate a good broker first and test your strategies in a dummy account before risking any real cash.  After a few weeks start off with small amounts, then gradually build as you gain experience. <br>
 <br>
You can either trade speculatively (day trading) (very risky, but can be highly lucrative) or invest for medium to long term. <br>
 <br>
Look up some sites with technical analysis facilities from graphs eg ***updata.co.uk AND ***igmarkets***, to learn about moving averages, Fiboncci, Gann index, Ichimoku, Bollinger, etc.   You may need to open trial accounts without obligation. <br>
 <br>
If you need guidance or help, please IM. <br>
 <br>
BE EXTREMELY CAREFUL!!! Good luck.

</script><p> S tocks means Shares of different companies.  Theoretically stock owner is partial owner of that industry. It has rights. <br>
Depending upon how many buyers are there for sellers i.e. demand and supply for purchase and sale.. price changes <br>
More demand price go up <br>
less demand or more supply  price goes down <br>
This happens on computerized system. <br>
In old days people used to shout their prices on  stock exchange. thanks to computers <br>
because of computers, one can buy and sell shares from anywhere in the country. even for other countries one can buy/sale. <br>
Those who buy shares and hold for longer times are known as investors. Investors look toward stocks as secondary and look as investment <br>
Those who buy and sale in day are known as traders.  They do it for living. <br>
 <br>
One need to open an brokerage account with brokers or banks to do this.
