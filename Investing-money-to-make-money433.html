<h1>Investing money to make money???</h1>
<div class="answer">I want to invest money for the future but I don&amp;#39;t know what to invest in.  Is there long term investments besides 401K that I can make money with?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Investments are subject to risk.  when you invest you may make money and you also may loose money.  If you had invested in Intel in 1999, you would have lost a great deal of money by now or Cisco or Dell.    <br>
 <br>
As for alternatives to 401k accounts.  There is a very good alternative in a Roth IRA account.  All money earned in a Roth IRA account is tax free forever unlike a 401k account in which the taxes are just deferred. <br>
 <br>
There are mutual funds that over the long term--10 years-- have returned an average annually of 10+%.  However, many of those have lost money during one or more years during that period.  A couple of my favorites are PENNX and GAM and TDF.  The last two are closed end funds.  GAM just paid its year end dividend so it would be a great time to invest.

</script><p> Looking for a long haul nest egg type stock. Look for large strong companies who will pay you a dividend.  <br>
 <br>
Examples in the Financial sector Citibank (stock symbol C) or Bank of America (BAC) paying about 4% dividends, <br>
 <br>
Communications ATT (T) and Verizon (VZ) are paying over 4% also.  <br>
 <br>
There are others take a look around.  <br>
 <br>
A safer bet would be ETF&#039;s you should read up on those. I currently own SDY a dividend ETF that has about 2.5% dividend yield. Not much but the YTD growth has been 11%. I hope it keeps up. When it reaches 20% I&#039;ll sell a little to take some profit and find another ETF to invest in.  <br>
 <br>
Happy Hunting
        </p> Buy stock directly,you can purchase stock of the electric company and slowly make money one day at a time.Do not buy a mutual fund you can invest on your own without paying some so called expert who does not know what he is doing.Ask yourself how many mutual funds lose money in a year.Guess what these are the so called experts that will help you lose money and then charge you a fee for that lousy losing advice.Educate yourself and invest without these so called experts.just remember warren buffets net worth when he was born was zero and now he is well off and all without some mutual fund.
        </p> A great site to look at if you are looking for investing ideas is http://***top10traders***  <br>
 <br>
The site lists out which investors are doing the best and what stocks they have bought. Just click on the portfolio of the best investors and you can see the stocks they like. <br>
 <br>
This is a totally FREE site. You can create your own portfolio of stocks with $100,000 in &#039;play&#039; money, and then watch how your stocks compare against other traders. It is a great way to learn about investing (and you don&#039;t have to risk losing any money) <br>
Good luck !
        </p> I suggest Faircent
        </p> You can always look to small cap stocks that will have strong growth in the future. However the economy may slow in the coming years.
        </p> sure! Mutual funds with a ten year track record or longer is what I look at
        </p> keep 70% in secured asses ts like real estate and 30% in stocks.
        </p>
