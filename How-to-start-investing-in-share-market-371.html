</script><p> To Start Investing                                                                         <br>
It takes a long time to learn the stock market and it would help if you read some books and information online.  Before you start investing in the market the first thing you need to decide is what risk level you want to take.  CDs backed up by the government has about 3-4% annual return for the long term with a low risk.  Bonds or Bonds Funds has about 5-7% annual return for the long term with a medium risk.  Stocks or Stock Mutual Funds has about 8-10% annual return for the long term with a high risk and are more volatile than Bonds. A person could make more than 10% annual return with the right investment. Usually the more risk you take, the more return you will have, but not always.  To see the Risk vs Return go to my photo:   http://i1142.photobucket***/albums/n620...   The stock market is basally made up of stocks and bonds.  Investment managers pick a group of stocks to make a mutual fund or a group of bonds to make a bond fund.  They even put a mixture of stocks and bonds together and call it a Growth &amp; Income Fund.   <br>
  <br>
1- MUTUAL FUNDS: I like mutual funds because they have a group of stocks (could be around 100+) invested in different sectors, and manage by a professional. Managers have lots of schooling for investing in stocks, around 8 years. So I think managers can pick stocks better than I can. You can make a buy or sell order anytime of the day for mutual funds shares but it will not go in affect until the close of the day. There are lots of different kinds of mutual funds that does not charge any fees to buy it&#039;s shares and they are called Noload Funds. There are also some funds called Load Funds that charge about 5% of your investment. But what I don&#039;t like is the fact that most funds has trading restriction and you may not be able to trade more than 4 times a year. That&#039;s because it makes it hard for the fund to make a good return if there is to much trading in the fund, causing the fund manager to make more buys and sells and keep more cash on hand. Mutual funds are meant for long term investors. <br>
2- STOCKS: Stocks is more volatile than funds unless you spread you money in about ten different sectors and know witch sector will do best. Stock trading restriction is only a few days and that&#039;s something that I like. If you own stocks, you will need to keep up with all the company&#039;s business so you don&#039;t get stuck with a bad stock. That could take a lots of time. I think a person that buys a few stocks is taking more risk hoping to make a bigger return. If that&#039;s the case, look at the leverage ETFs. <br>
3- ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds): ETFs are like a mutual fund but trades like a stock and that is my main reason why I like ETFs. There are some ETFs that represents Index&#039;s. An Index is like S&amp;P or DOW. Index&#039;s operate just like a mutual fund with a group of stocks in deferent sectors, manage by professionals.  You can&#039;t buy Index&#039;s because they are not for sell.  A company owns them.  But you can buy a mutual funds or an ETF that has the same stocks as the Index they represent. There are a lots of different kinds of ETFs for someone to choose from. Some have 1x leverage, some have 2x leverage for aggressive investors, and some has 3x leverage for more aggressive investors. There are some that represent almost every kind of sector.    <br>
 <br>
You can find several good brokers that charge $8.00 and under, per stock trade and no fee on Noload Funds. Most broker websites have good research tools. Some popular broker websites are Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, E-trade, Scottrade and others.  I think you need a min. of $500 (some sites $2,500) to open a broker account and need to be at lease 18 years old. If you not 18, you might could get your Dad to open an account for you.

</script><p> Standard investment advice is that you should invest in a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and money market funds.  If you are like most people you will invest part of your money aggressively in stocks, and part conservatively in money market funds and bond funds.  However, some young people will go all stocks, and some very conservative people will go all money markets.  The links below have on-line questionnaires which will give you an idea of how to do &quot;Asset Allocation,&quot; determining how much to put in each type of investment. <br>
  <br>
You want to buy a diversified portfolio of stocks as individual stocks are too risky. Highly knowledgeable people can buy a properly balanced portfolio, but most folks have a difficult time balancing things on their own. They will misbalance their portfolio by buying all small stocks or all growth stocks, or some other misbalanced assortment of stocks.  Back in 2000, Some people bought all Internet stocks; they got burnt when they all crashed together.  You have to diversify across industries.  Unless you know what you are doing, it is best to buy mutual funds that will diversify for you.  Buy no-load, low cost funds.  Mutual funds should have expense ratios of less than 0.5%.   <br>
  <br>
I like index funds. Because of their broad diversification, you are less likely to have a dramatic drop in value. They also have the lowest management fees. For stock funds, I like putting ~70% of one&#039;s money in the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund. and ~30% in the Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund. The Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund is good for a bond fund.  The Vanguard Target Retirement funds can be a good all-in-one stock and bond funds for an IRA.   (If you have less than 3,000 dollars, you can&#039;t invest in most Vanguard funds. For such people I would suggest Schwab funds.)  There are many different opinions out there on what the best mutual funds are. Read the links below and form your own opinion. <br>
 <br>
  <br>
Once you have stared investing, you need to keep adding money on a regular basis.  Many funds allow you to set up automatic investment programs that take a set amount of money out of your bank account each month. <br>
 <br>
If your company offers a 401K plan at work, try to invest the most you can.   The money grows tax free, and some companies will match your contribution. Investing in a mutual fund IRA is also a good idea. If you have children, you may want to consider a 529 plan or other college savings plan that grows tax free. <br>
  <br>
If you have high-interest debt, like credit cards, it is best to pay this off first before trying most of the investment ideas above. You should also have 3-6 months of salary saved up as an emergency fund in a bank or money market fund before trying more risky investments.  <br>
 <br>
I will warn you that there is a tremendous amount of stock investing books and websites that teach stock investing strategies that don&#039;t work.  Particularly bad are people that teach &quot;technical analysis&quot; systems that sound impressive, but don&#039;t work. <br>
 <br>
Believing advice you get on Yahoo answers can be risky, so read these websites for further information. If you find it too confusing, contact a professional financial advisor. They will charge you significant commissions, however.
        </p> The best way to learn is to try virtual trading first. Read books on the subject but nothing beats hands on practice, it is the quickest way to learn and it is free....best of all any losses are only on paper. <br>
 <br>
WSS is one of the best ones with &#039;real time trading&#039; and a very user friendly site where you can get news, analysis and free tutorials.
