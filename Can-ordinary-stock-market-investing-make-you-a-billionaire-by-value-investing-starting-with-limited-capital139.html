<h1>Can ordinary stock market investing make you a billionaire by value investing starting with limited capital?</h1>
<div class="answer">I want to know in your opinion if you think that ordinary stock market investing applied with value investing techniques, i.e. buy low, sell high using undervalued stocks with high growth potential could make you a stock market billionaire and if it could be done all on your own from your own home stating with limited capital such as £5,000 as I know that you don&amp;#39;t need to employ people or run a physical business to be a stock market investor and the rewards can be massive. Could it work and has anybody ever done this before?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> there is no way you are going to make a profit on every single stock trade you make - if you make 10-15% a yr over many years, you&#039;re doing pretty good - you could and probably will lose money over short or long periods of time - there are no guarantees of gain/profit in life with any kind of investment <br>
 <br>
you could buy low and the stock could go lower. no one guesses right all the time or probably even 65% of the time <br>
 <br>
there are only a few hundred Billionaires in the entire world and I don&#039;t think any of them got to be Billionaires just by trading in stocks, starting with 5,000 or even 5 million - most got super rich by starting companies that wound up going public and they owned millions of shares of the companies stock from the start

</script><p> most people do not plain and simple.Any e-mail you get or mail shot telling you how easy it is to make money on the stock market is a con.You cannot make the huge sums city traders make simply because you need the financial backing of a major investment group to make the kind of gambles these gamblers make and for the return to be sufficiently large to make it worth while.Its a bit like an on-line race tipster he has a hundred people who send him ten pounds a week for tips so he earns £4000 a month nearly 50 grand a year. yet every race he sends out tips to every person except in a ten horse race every horse will be sent to ten people .Now if he spreads the favourites and second favourites around his hundred people they are bound to hit occasionally and on every race he will have at least ten people that he picked a winner for even if a complete outsider wins .I would also point out that most of the big money deals are made by insider trading which the SFO has recently made several arrests .Because these traders are not playing with their own money they can easily gamble billions.

They are sometimes referred to as &quot;the slot machines of the equity market&quot; because of the money involved.

        </p> Short answer NO! What you are suggesting is gambling so remember the house always wins. Stock picking is for suckers!
        </p> I guess that some people have succeeded in this way, but, you have to be a gambler, and be able to afford to lose!
        </p> You can and you will be brave to try. There is a proviso that you will never know who you true friends are.
