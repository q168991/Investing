</script><p> You will need your PAN card and a bank account before you can do anything about stock market. If you don&#039;t have these two things, apply for them first. <br>
You will need three accounts to invest in stock markets: a bank account, a demat account and a trading account. You can approach any broker. They will help you opening your demat and trading accounts. <br>
For stock market knowledge, you need to read a lot. Among newspapers, I would suggest The Economic Times. Especially on Mondays, they publish personal finance edition, which will be quite useful to you. DNA Money newspaper might also be good for you. <br>
Among magazines, you can read business today or business world. They will give you updates about the companies. If you want to read magazines specifically related to stock market, you can also read Capital Market or any other such magazines. <br>
Among books, I would highly recommend &quot;The Intelligent Investor&quot; by Benjamin Graham. This author is the Guru of Warren Buffett, the billionnaire investor. <br>
Among TV shows, you can watch any business channels - CNBC TV18, NDTV Profit or ET NOW. These three channels are in English, while CNBC Awaaz is in hindi language.

</script><p> Are you able to invest in the global share market, or only in the Indian market?  <br>
 <br>
Start by going to the library and borrowing a basic book on stockmarket investing, such as one of the &quot;Idiot&#039;s ..&quot; or &quot;Dummies ...&quot; series of books. When you understand how the market works and know how to pick stocks based on fundamentals or technical analysis, then go to the financial section of newspapers and make your choice. <br>
 <br>
Investing in the stock market is not a shortcut to wealth. Investing involves risk. The shares you buy can go up or down. Do not invest money you cannot afford to lose.
