</script><p> Penny stocks are wildly inappropriate for a novice investor.  They are not starter stocks, but rather the riskiest part of the market. <br>

If you invest in real stocks instead of penny stock debris, Schwab is quite reliable.

</script><p> I don&#039;t know the answer, but what I do know is that ScotTrade has been good to me at $7/trade. You open an account. Your money actually earns interest if it&#039;s not invested. They have free advice and classes. I have no complaints about them.
        </p> For penny stock those trading company will charge a fee per share traded. Either of them are find.
