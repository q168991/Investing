</script><p> If you don&#039;t have any professional or business exp. than put it in your fix (term) bank account. A banking option which provide you to keep your money for long and short term period, you wont be able to get it, until the term/period over. This is the best way to keep it safe..... other wise it wont last long, trust me.
        </p> That depends on how long it will be before you need the money? Short term: put it in the bank.  Longer term: invest it in Apple stock.
        </p> Forever stamps.  They are certainly safe.
