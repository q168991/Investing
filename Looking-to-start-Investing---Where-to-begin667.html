</script><p> Hi D$, <br>
 <br>
Why don&#039;t you go to your local bookstore, find the personal investment section and look at a few books?  See what may be in the table of contents that might interest you or be the kind of material you&#039;re looking to read -- then you can decide your next move. <br>
 <br>
Go slow and digest what you read, then you&#039;ll have a clearer idea of where to go next. <br>
 <br>
Good luck!

</script><p> Take a year and read some of the weekly/monthly financial magazines, such as Money, Fortune, BusinessWeek. Watch CNBC as much as you can. Look at some of the financial websites that offer you the daily summary. <br>
By the time you buy a book on the subject it is already outdated. Never listen to anyone&#039;s latest and greatest recommendations. Take your time studying, and remember, you will make mistakes as does everyone. Just make them on the smaller investments and you&#039;ll be in good shape.
        </p> The Motley Fool website is excellent for beginner investors. They break everything down in layman terms so there is no fancy financial talk involved. I personally like seekingalpha***. It has a nice section for beginners as well. As for books, there are a ton. Go to a local barnes and noble and you can easily pick up as many books on investing as you&#039;d like. I&#039;d recommend anything by Waffen Buffet and or course The Motley Fool also has a few good books out there.

It&#039;s a book. My grandfather got it for me when I was 7 years old, and it&#039;s the best book I&#039;ve ever read. It will take you 2 hour to read cover-to-cover, and when you&#039;re done, you will have a very basic understanding of stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. One of the few books that I have read cover-to-cover for pleasure.
