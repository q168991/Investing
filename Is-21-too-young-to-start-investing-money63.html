<h1>Is 21 too young to start investing money?</h1>
<div class="answer">I will be 21 soon and I have $3000 that I would like to invest, is 21 too soon?  My parents pay for college and I do not have a high car note or living expenses, would investing the money be a good idea?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> The younger you are, the more you&#039;ll benefit from compound interest.   Compound interest results in exponential growth.   $3,000 is a good start but what&#039;s best is a regular monthly investment, then you can take advantage of dollar cost averaging.    Finance books are also a good investment, try to read one a month.   They tend to all have the same ideas phrased in different manners but the idea is to drill it into your head so that it all becomes second nature and automatic.   You need to make financial awareness part of your daily life.

Penny stocks, also known as cent stocks in some countries, are common shares of small public companies that trade at low prices per share. They are notoriously risky but if you follow a special method I&#039;ve learned you can earn good money at almost no risk. This is the site I use: http://pennystocks.toptips.org <br>
 <br>
I definitely recommend subscribing to this site in particular. Very good research, quality stocks. I was a bit weary of penny stocks from all the bad hype they receive but this guy is pretty legit. He&#039;s put my mind at ease with a lot of the fears I&#039;ve had. I especially like that he doesn&#039;t send out announcements left and right. I&#039;ve signed up for other websites that fill my in-box with one company after the other. I don&#039;t know where to even start with so many choices in front of me! Nathan sends me one idea a week and that&#039;s all I need. Working so many hours during the week leaves me with very little time when I get home to start doing tons of penny stock research. I&#039;m always eager to see what Nathan&#039;s next suggestion is each Friday and I love having time on the weekend to do my research.  <br>
 <br>
As said above if you want to make money with penny stocks you have to follow some proven methods. This one in my opinion is the best: http://pennystocks.toptips.org <br>
Have a nice day
        </p> You are NEVER too young to invest your money. Some families get shares of stock for their infants so when they get older they&#039;ll be worth TONS more. Investing your money would be a FANTASTIC idea. Also, don&#039;t go for companies that have already made it big (apple for instance). The cost for the share is much too high and it isn&#039;t likely that it will make you any more money. Hope this helps!
        </p> I started working with penny stocks less then one year ago and I think it&#039;s great! There are a lot of opportunities to make big money, you just need to find them! <br>
 <br>
At the beginning for me was really useful the support of this method http://penny-stock.keysolve.net  <br>
 <br>
It&#039;s a simple course that will teach you how to move your first steps and how to grow fast in this buisness. <br>
I will tell you how was my first experience: <br>
I started with a lighting technology company that was overdue a breakout from 75 cents. <br>
Just two weeks after I alerted my subscribers… that breakout arrived! A 362% return later and the stock had risen to $3.47 cents… <br>
Turning my starting stake of $1,000 into $4,625, and it was just the beginning!
        </p> You are never to young to invest. <br>
It&#039;s a good idea to save as much as possible. <br>
Hope this helps.
        </p> No way Jose, youve got to have allot of money to retire when you get older cuz chances are you wont get squat from social security so youve got to start early. Just make sure that you always have a cushion of univested money should something unexpected arise.
        </p> Yes , start investing the money now , my son is 14 and he stockbrokes on imiweb . Paid for our holiday last year . I would keep to shares , not commodities . do it , you&#039;ll enjoy it !
        </p> investing your money is a good thing,but be very careful where you put bit as it may disappear right in front of you.
        </p> yes but don&#039;t miss the fun, so invest and have fun without losing it
        </p> That is a good question. I would buy a little in something safe to get my feet wet so to speak.
