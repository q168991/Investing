 <br>
I am an options trader. It is my opinion, if your goal is to earn modest and consistent profits in the equity markets this in the most effective method. If you read a few books and decide that you have an interest in options trading.

 <br>
If you would like some “Old School” books… (from a time when the only tools traders had were price action, volume and tape reading) although these books are clearly out of date, I believe the careful reader can uncover principals that still apply today; just as they did many years ago. Here is list of a few of my favorites: <br>
 <br>

The Battle for Investment Survival By G.M. Loeb <br>
How to trade in Stocks By Jesse Livermore <br>
Tape Reading and Market Tactics By Humphrey B. Neill <br>
