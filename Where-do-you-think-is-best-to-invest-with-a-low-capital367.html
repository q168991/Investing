</script><p> First off, read about 10 books on trading/investing the stock market to get an understanding of how the markets react during economically good times and in bad. (this is for your own advantage. this should only take as long as you need to go over the material if it is new to you.) <br>
You can open an account on line with as little as $500 for example. <br>
Most people shun penny stocks however, I favor them. <br>
check out STOCKCHARTS.COM  for daily listings.  <br>
*buy low-sell high. <br>
You can see that the average stock increases 100% in a years time &quot;if&quot; you hold on to it during the down times, and sell at peak opportunities when the stock becomes wanted. <br>
supply/demand  factor. <br>
Do your own research. some pennies do go out of business for sure. <br>
with good effort and know-how, you can turn $500 into at least $1000- 3000  on the average. <br>
you do the math. <br>
after the 3rd year at this model.......you&#039;ll have a lot of money. <br>
OR you may be out a total of your investment of $500 at the most. <br>
Either way , glad to see you are considering your future financial standing, and DOING SOMETHING ABOUT IT! =)

</script><p> If by &quot;capital&quot; you mean not much money, your options are limited.  There are online savings accounts with no minimums that pay around 5%.  Most mutual funds have a minimum (lower for IRAs), stocks, depending on the brokerage, probably have no minimum but commissions will eat up a lot of your money and there&#039;s no return on those.
