</script><p> First thing I would do is open an online account with Fidelity or other good brokerage house. Mail them the $5K for deposit into your account. You will earn money market rates while it is in there. I would then buy a 1 year CD where you should be able to get a 5% rate. That will give you a whole year to learn more about what to do with your money and in that year, you will discover that things change so hasty decisions are usually not good ones. Some will recommend a Roth IRA, but I believe you want to get into common stocks as a buy and hold strategy. You have a long life ahead of you. Starting now to learn the ways of investing and saving will make you wealthy. A 5% firm return in hand is always better than a possible 10% return that goes south. Reach carefully to start with.
        </p> Your first option should be to fund fully a retirement account. If you do this, and you have extra cash, then one of the best things you can do is open a DRIP Plan. <br>

 <br>
Click on the &quot;DRIP&#039;s&quot; Button on the Navigation Bar <br>
 <br>
These powerful investment plans are seldom talked about because brokers make very little money when they suggest them. Yet, they have proven to be one of the best, if not the best, long-term strategy on Wall Street.  <br>
 <br>
They are perfect for small investors, as well as big investors. They are safe and allow you to not care about whether the market is going up or down. They are a must for any serious investor. <br>
 <br>
If you decide you are interested in DRIP Plans, click on the advertisement on the same page &quot;$4 to purchase stocks&quot;. This will answer your next question, which is, How do I get started? and what is the least expensive way to get started? <br>
 <br>
I strongly recommend looking into it. They are great plans. <br>
 <br>
Good Luck

Put $10,000 and get back $18,424 in 5 years (compound interest). No fees. <br>
