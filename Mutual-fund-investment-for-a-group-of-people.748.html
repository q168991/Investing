</script><p> It depends on your broker. <br>
I would check the morning star rating for the best performing funds, but remember if its already run, like a Chinese stock mutual fund it may have already run out of steam. <br>
You could research Bershire Hathaway stock, its like a mutual fund but I think stocks are much better to deal with.

</script><p> If you have a group of people, just form an investment club.  You can set up a contract where everyone has to agree to make it work.  The amount each participant puts in each month must be determine so that the club can make the minimum investment per purchase of the mutual fund.  Since everyone is involved, have everyone do the research to find their pick and give the presentation to the group why their pick meets the clubs requirements and maybe a closed ballot vote to determine which fund to invest in.  Vanguard has the lowest expense ratios in the industry.  There index funds have ratios less than 1.0% in which the industry norm is between 1.0 and 2.0.  Maybe check out http://investmentclubhelp***/ or Yahoo! it to find more info on clubs.
        </p> most mutual funds are best if the holding period is longer than 1-2 years, although you could still make a profit if the stock market is consistently rising <br>

I have sunlife mutual funds and in my country the stock market is having a bull run so a lot of people are happy. <br>
 <br>
go to a sunlife office and ask them for advice
        </p> Yes, an investment group can purchase real estate. This can be done through the formation of an LLC or Partnership. It is a straight forward process which can be facilitated by a real estate attorney. Commercial real estate is by nature more complex and would require a more specialized attorney but either way it is frequently done.
        </p> Do not do that.  Bad idea.
