<h1>Which is best between both LIC Jeevan saral policy for 20 years or investing in FD for 20 years?</h1>
<div class="answer">Which is best between both LIC Jeevan saral policy for 20 years or investing in FD for 20 years? I had taken LIC&amp;#39;s Jeevan saral policy for 20 years term last year which cost me 12000 p.a. premuim. Now i want to invest another 12000rs. p.a. It will be good idea to take FD of 12000 for 3/5 years per year for next 20 years or should again have to take LIC policy? I am 26 years old male. In my view LIC will not fetch me more income compared to FD&amp;#39;s although LIC has security of insurance of my life.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
