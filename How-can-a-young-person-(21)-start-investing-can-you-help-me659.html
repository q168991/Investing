<h1>How can a young person (21) start investing? can you help me?</h1>
<div class="answer">I don&amp;#39;t have any property.  I can save up to $800 a month to put into a savings account.  I currently saved up $5,000.  

i don&amp;#39;t know anything about investing.  So i just have it put into online savings accounts.  and i only got $500 dollar in a CD which gives me 3.5% for one year.  so in one year i get $517 which i think is bad.  

my online savings account is currently 2.20% compounded monthly.  

my credit should be pretty good.  i paid off a car loan of 8,000.  and i got 13,300 credit limit.  3,300 and 10,000 visa and mastercard.  so i think credit wise i&amp;#39;m good.  i just don&amp;#39;t know what to do with money i save.  i want to save up money for a dodge challenger when i graduate from my university.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> First things first.  STAY WELL AWAY from FX trading.  I see people who work for foreign exchange sites trying to lure people like you on Yahoo Answers all the time.  If you like losing in Vegas, then you&#039;re going to love trading the FX market. <br>
 <br>
There&#039;s nothing wrong with what you&#039;re doing.  Because there&#039;s no risk involved, you can focus more on your degree.  Tech stocks are where the money&#039;s being made at the moment, but that means watching charts all the time like I do.  It will distract you from your studies.  <br>
 <br>
Forget about investing and the dodge challenger for now.  Secure your degree first so you&#039;ll never look back with regret. <br>
 <br>
Trust me, I&#039;ll probably be a billionaire some day, and I&#039;ll still want to fill that hole in my life where I missed out on a degree until I return to college and achieve one. <br>
 <br>
There will always be an investment market there for you tomorrow.  Just keep keep you&#039;re eyes and ears open.  When there&#039;s money involved 20% of people will help you, the other 80% are crooks.
        </p> You can open a brokerage account and put your money there instead of in the savings account. While the money sits in your brokerage it also earns interest, like the savings. However in the brokerage account you&#039;ll have the ability to make some extra profits by executing winning trades when you spot a good opportunity. <br>
 <br>
Since you are on a small budget, I would suggest investing in an index fund or ETF so you are diversified in more than one or two stocks.  <br>
 <br>
Do automatic deposit into your brokerage every month and build your position. Once I get up to about 10,000 I might find myself 3 stocks and spread my money amongst them. <br>
 <br>
BTW, in the resource box below is a link to a free report that will show you how to set up your brokerage account and take you through the steps on how to place your first trade.  <br>
 <br>
Good luck.
        </p> Hi <br>
I trade the currency market and with the power of compounding its incredible how quickly your money can grow.  For example if you start with $150 and make 10 pips per day ($100) everyday for 12 months and compound only 50% of it you would at the end of the year have around $60 000!  The key is learning how to trade successfully and that does take time and effort. <br>
I i meet up with some incredible guys in Melbourne who teach forex trading. <br>
The seminar is run by FX Masters who are based in Melbourne. They take people from all backgrounds to no trading knowledge at all to earning a fulltime income from trading currencies in around 6 months. They teach the basics right up to advanced trading strategies with ongoing support and coaching for as long as is required. The results these guys are achieving is incredible. Over a 21/2 lunch with Lance, I watched him trade and make a 300% profit. He has students all over the world many of whom start trading with as little as $150. They won&#039;t let you start trading live until you are consisently achieve 80% winning trades. <br>
Lance has an amazing story. He spent 3 years reading 8 hours a day to work out a successful trading plan. He started with $2000 and within 12 months was generating $40 000 per day. He has been trading for about 15 years. <br>
These guys know what they are doing! <br>
Its one of best ways to make money in the current economic climate. <br>
The next scheduled course is in Melbourne on the 21 and 22 of March. There will also be one in Adelaide the first weekend in April.
        </p> Go far Mutual Funds - where you can star investing even with small amount and continue further investments through SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) mode - which will automatically take care of further regular (monthly) investments by way of ECS - through standing instructions. <br>
If you ask your banker, they will help you out as they will be selling Mutual Fund Products too.
        </p> If you are serious to invest and you are over age of 18, you can google for HSFX Asset Management and start making consistent returns!
