<h1>I&#039;ve got $5K to invest. I&#039;m maxed out in my 401K (no company match). How should I invest it?</h1>
<div class="answer">I won&amp;#39;t get a pension. What&amp;#39;s the best way to invest this money for retirement in 20 years.  I&amp;#39;m hearing about ROTHs, DRIPS, Index funds and Annuities.  Anyone out there found something that worked for them??  Articles and website recommendations accepted as well.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> If you qualify (you have to be below certain income levels) then an Roth IRA is the best.  You pay taxes on the money now, but then you don&#039;t have to pay later.  Second choice is an IRA, again if your income is below certain levels so that you qualify to be able to invest.   <br>
 <br>
I&#039;m not buying an annuity until I&#039;m 65 and retired.  I looked into fixed and variable annuities for myself and decided against it until I turn 65 based on the rate of return, the guarantees they give you, and their high costs.  But at 65 an annuity might be a good deal since it would give you a certain amount of guaranteed income, depending upon what you buy.   <br>
 <br>
DRIPs are good (Dividend Reinvestment Plans).  You sign up to buy stock of certain companies that offer a DRIP and you don&#039;t have to pay the usual high commissions you&#039;d have to pay a stockbroker.  Search on DRIPs on the Internet, and you should be able to find some. <br>
 <br>
Index funds are OK, but they follow whatever their index is, exactly.  In other words, if the stock market goes down and you are invested in a total stock market index fund, then your investment will also go down.   <br>
 <br>
For just $5,000 and since you don&#039;t seem to have a lot of knowledge about the stock market, I&#039;d suggest getting a mutual fund.  You&#039;ll pay to have someone else take care of your investment, but sometimes it&#039;s worth it.  I&#039;ve done well with Vanguard.  They have a large number of funds and their expenses are fairly low, which means you get to keep more of your money.  Their Vanguard Star account invests in several other mutual funds, which gives you a bit of diversification (so your money is put into a lot of different things, all with one investment).  You can visit Vanguard&#039;s website, or call them.  If you are eligible for a Roth or an IRA, you can open the account that way - just tell Vanguard (or whoever you pick) if you want it in a retirement account.  (The paperwork is different for retirement and non-retirement accounts.)   <br>
 <br>
I would NOT suggest target date mutual funds.  Some people like them, because all you have to do is figure out what year you retire and invest a fund that is closest to that year, then the fund keeps changing the allocation and becoming more conservative as you approach retirement.  I don&#039;t like them because some of them really lost money during the recent market downturn, and different ones allocate differently - so you don&#039;t really know which one to buy.

</script><p> If you are maxed out on your 401K and have an AGI (Adjusted Gross Income) of less than $167,000.00 if you are married and less than $106,000.00 if you are single......I would say you have three choices, ROTH, ROTH or.....A ROTH. If you are above these levels allocation models offered in most fund families would suit you well. <br>
We have been teaching &quot;Tax-Deferral&quot; for just about ever now, and have come to find that was good for some but not most. The question you must pose to yourself is, &quot;Do I want to pay taxes on the seed.....or the crop??  <br>
You see, if you bite-the-bullet, so to speak on paying the taxes up front you will not have to eat the bullet on the taxes later if you stick with ROTH or ROTH LIKE investments right now.  <br>
&quot;Just Pay Attention&quot;
        </p> Start a Roth IRA if your income meets the MAGI criteria. <br>
 <br>
DRIPS, index funds and annuities are types of investments - not retirement accounts in and of themselves.
