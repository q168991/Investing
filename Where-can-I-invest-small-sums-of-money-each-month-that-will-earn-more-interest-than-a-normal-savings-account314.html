<h1>Where can I invest small sums of money each month that will earn more interest than a normal savings account?</h1>
<div class="answer">I&amp;#39;m 17 and working part time. I want to be able to redeem it at about age 22 and have made more interest than the .01 % that I would get a the bank. I was planning on saving probably $25-$50 per month. I considered savings bonds but it would only get 1.4% and is not really worth the hassle.
Any Ideas?

Would a DRP program be useful? Any suggestions on where to start in this?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

 <br>
I have put money in saving bonds -- TIPS Bonds now -- my entire life.  I started when I was about your age.  I&#039;m 55 now.  Forget the current rate.  With small amounts of money, that isn&#039;t the point.  (Think about it -- is 10% of $25 per year a lot of money?  No, it is not) <br>
 <br>
Try a credit union.  And open an money market account.  It will be fine for your purpose. <br>
 <br>
I also started investing in DRP&#039;s when I was young.  I still have one -- ExxonMobil (it was Mobil when I started) -- and it is worth several hundred thousand dollars.  But it is worth emphasizing:  I never sold any of it and I reinvested every single dividend payment.  The dividend -- please also note -- has averaged around 2% on new money for a very long time. But it is much, much higher on all that old money I put in and never took out. <br>
 <br>
(Stocks pay dividends as &quot;cents per share.&quot;  If you buy a share for $1 and it pays 2 cents per share, that&#039;s a 2% dividend on new money.  If the price goes up to $10 a share and the company is still paying about 2%, that&#039;s 20 cents a share.  But if I still own the $1 share, I get the 20 cents (per share, not per dollar invested).  20 cents is 20% on a $1 purchase price.  Pretty darn good return in any day and age)

</script><p> DRIP programs are great but keep in mind.... this is a long term investment, which can go up or down. While you may expect to make money... you could easily lose 20%, 30% or more depending on the company and the economy.
