</script><p> Before investing, you should first research the best trading platforms. A lot of platforms require a minimum balance before you can begin investing, and each offers benefits in terms of commission costs, and stuff like that.  <br>
 <br>
First chose a platform. Then save enough to meet the minimum balance requirement. Then research stocks. <br>
 <br>
I&#039;m pretty new to investing too, but Value Investing approach seems to make the most sense to me. Some books I suggest to get you started is Rule #1 by Phil Town (although I don&#039;t like his technical analysis portion) and you should take a look at Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham (Warren Buffett&#039;s mentor). The former is a bit easier to read to get you started, whereas the ladder goes through many of the fundamental principles and mentalities a successful investor should have. <br>
 <br>
Good luck. <br>

OH. In response to the post above, yeah you could go with mutual funds which are supposed to be low-risk, but IF you do  your homework and research the stocks properly, you might do a lot better investing yourself... but that&#039;s just my opinion, i have yet to see the fruits of my own labor.

</script><p> Hi Chad, <br>
 <br>
As a young, minimally capitalized and inexperienced investor the best investment by far, would be in education. The stock market is no place for people who have no idea what they are doing. An analogy would be standing on one side of a busy six lane expressway blindfolded and attempting to cross to the other side to pick up a bag of cash with your name on it. The likelihood of your being flattened is much greater than that of you actually getting across. <br>
 <br>
But don&#039;t despair, learning how to invest intelligently is not particularly difficult. It doesn&#039;t have to be confusing although it can be if you let it. The key is to learn how to do just one thing, but become an expert at it. <br>
 <br>
Be patient. Get prepared. Save your money. The stock market will still be there when you are ready to make it work for you. <br>
 <br>
Think about it. <br>

        </p> best bet to play it safe is a mutual fund; they basically buy shares and bonds from multiple companies so your chances of doin bad are smaller.
