<h1>Should I invest in Mutual funds or Stocks in a Roth IRA ?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am contributing to 401k and maxing  it out as part of my employer&amp;#39;s retirement plan. The money in the 401k is getting invested in Mutual funds.

</script><p> You will get a bunch of different answers to this...and that&#039;s because no one but you can really answer the question properly. <br>
 <br>
I also know this probably won&#039;t be a popular answer in &quot;the community&quot; because I am a professional...and this site is popular with the &#039;we hate professionals&#039; crowd. But, I wanted to take the time to give you some honest and unbiased info...regardless of voting results. <br>
 <br>
The fact that you are asking the question shows that you are probably not comfortable/experienced in picking stocks...and that brings up the question... are you looking to buy stocks and hold them for the next 10-30 years+...or try to trade them like all the &quot;hype&quot; out there tells people they should do now? <br>
 <br>
Mutual fund investing is what I call &quot;investing with training wheels&quot;...you pay high fees and get diluted returns...but you have an &#039;element&#039; of reduced risk...possibly...too.  Also, $5,000 is what is considered &quot;smaller amounts of money&quot; in the professional investing world...so many &quot;professionals&quot; won&#039;t bother working with you or educating you either...because they&#039;re looking to &quot;get paid&quot;!!! <br>
 <br>
Your choices at this point are: <br>
*Find an advisor that will work with you...based upon a growing long term relationship potential...and/or... <br>
*Start educating yourself with various books and websites, etc. (Start learning about it) <br>
*Pick a mutual fund or five and &quot;diversify&quot; your money...if you have 30+ years and will continue contributing each year...you should probably go with small cap aggressive stuff (okay, Small/Medium), especially when the market is still about 2/3 what it was and you have a long term outlook....but others will say &quot;always diversify&quot; (the watered down risk, remember) and tell you to buy small/medium/large funds in growth or value catagories and short/long term bond funds...etc. <br>
*Pick one or two stocks and buy what you can with the money...but with enough shares it will actually make you money when it goes up (this is the &quot;riskier&quot; approach) <br>
 <br>
Either way...keep funding the company plan &amp; as much as possible...keep feeding the Roth...then as the market recovers you can build up the &quot;balanced&quot; approach...but trying to make some amazing returns while the market is still full of such opportunities...is rational...especially for some young enough to have 30 years to work with....maybe, if done right...It won&#039;t take so long to reach &#039;retirement&#039; afterall. <br>
 <br>
Note: There are a number of websites that you can visit and start learning on our own too...feel free to email me for them if you&#039;d like...otherwise...I hope this helped...don&#039;t be a sheep...think for yourself.

I am in the same boat. What I have decided to do is go ahead and do the nondeductible Traditional IRA each year. Here&#039;s why: There is a tax law on the books that, in 2010, will allow people in our situation to rollover our traditional IRAs to Roth IRAs without regard to our income level. Of course, we&#039;ll have to pay tax on any appreciation, but then the IRAs will appreciate tax-free, and any withdrawals at retirement will be tax free as well. The tax may be paid in 2010, 2011 and/or 2012.
        </p> Binary options let users trade in currency pairs and stocks for various predetermined time-periods, minimal of which is 30 seconds. Executing trades is straightforward. The system uses user-friendly interfaces, which even an 8 years old kid, can operate without having to read any instructions. But winning trades is Not easy.  <br>
Binary trading is advertised as the only genuine system that lets users earn preposterous amounts of money in ridiculously short period of time. Advertisers try to implicate as if you can make $350 every 60 seconds; if it was true then binary trading would truly be an astonishing business.  <br>
However, does it make any sense? Can every trader make tons of money in binary trading? Who is actually paying all the money or the profit to traders?  <br>
The first challenge is finding a trustworthy binary broker; secondly, you need to find a binary trading strategy, which you can use to make profits consistently. Without an effective trading strategy, there is no way you can make money in this business. <br>
Learning a profitable trading strategy is possible, You should watch this presentation video https://tr.im/4f450 <br>
It&#039;s probably the best way to learn how to win with binary option
        </p> Here is one thing to keep in mind about the Roth IRA account.  There is never any tax on it where as there is on your 401k.  This becomes important when considering your asset mix.  Income producing investments are taxed at the full tax rate as will be your 401k.  Hence it makes sense to invest at least some of your 401k in income producing assets--bonds, LPs, REITs.  The income from each of those is taxed at the full tax rate anyway.  Now since the Roth IRA is never taxed,  it also makes sense to put those types of assets into the Roth IRA also.  And also equity investments.   <br>
 <br>
What you neglected to mention are investments outside of these two vehicles.  If you have some, they should be investments that would be taxed at the capital gains rate--equity investments.  Actually, unless you are in the highest tax bracket it makes sense to have a portion of your equity investments outside of a 401k.  By doing so your total tax bill will be decreased, especially if you are a long term investor.   <br>
 <br>
If you have the least hankering to invest some of your money in gold and silver those absolutely should be within a Roth IRA.  Both are taxed as collectibles otherwise.  <br>
 <br>
Another thing to consider in regard to the 401k is that in future years the tax rate might actually be higher, perhaps much higher, than it currently is.  <br>
 <br>
Since you really have no choice of placing non-mutual fund investments within a 401k except for perhaps company stock, it certainly does make sense to invest Roth IRA money in company stocks rather than mutual funds.  But be careful.  It is very tempting for many to speculate with their Roth IRA account especially short term trading which otherwise would be taxed at the full tax rate.  That would be a good way to reduce that value of the Roth account. Be just a little cautious.  Invest in the likes of MCD, WMT, JNJ, BDX, KO, etc.  Or maybe ETP with its 8% dividend or PAA with its 7.5% dividend.  And do not invest it in fewer than 5 different companies.
        </p> Depends on your investment philosophy or risk levels.  Individual stocks are more risky since your only own a few individual stocks compares to mutual funds that in general have over 100 equities or stocks in their portfolio and give you divisification and management expertise.   <br>
 <br>
Overall, the safe move is to invest in a good mutual fund unless you know how to pick great and safe stocks. You may want to do a combination of both for instance buy one stock and with the rest buy a mutual fund. Good luck!
        </p> Hello, <br>
I&#039;ve been trading the market for just a few months. My cousin actually told me about this website ( http://pennystocks.toptips.org ) and I signed up immediately after. This is my honest review about their method. I&#039;m not someone who has a lot of time to be researching for ideas because I work many hours. they made it incredibly easy for me to make money in the market. Their reports are easy to read and follow. I&#039;ve tracked most of the stock ideas that I&#039;ve received in my e-mail from them and MANY have seen some nice gains after their announcements. I&#039;ve made a nice profit (55% return on my investment on one, and 112% on the other!) on a couple of suggestions he&#039;s given and plan to start trading his ideas a lot more.  <br>

 <br>
 <br>
If you&#039;re a rookie in investing or stocks, go to <br>
 <br>
***finance.yahoo***. <br>
 <br>
Open up a portfolio without using real money. You can give yourself as much or as little money to try out the market. The stocks you want to focus on is consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and healthcare. These are DEFENSIVE stocks that will survive through good and bad times. Most of my positions are in these stocks. Some names include 3M, Procter &amp; Gamble, Kimberly Clark, Exxon Mobil, Walmart, Costco. Everybody&#039;s got to eat and wipe their butts regardless of the state of economy. Many of these companies survived through the Great Depression. <br>
 <br>
That&#039;s the benefits. You can sleep at night knowing your money is doing well. There are NO guarantees that you won&#039;t lose money. It&#039;s just that these stocks are the best. They pay good dividends too. <br>
 <br>
Then once you&#039;re comfortable and test the waters of the market, you can finally put some real money in. Go to Scottrade***. They&#039;re excellent for beginners. <br>
 <br>
If you&#039;re new to stocks, DON&#039;T DAY TRADE. You&#039;ll a rookie in a world of professionals. I tried day-trading with Citigroup and AIG when they were a little bit over $1. I had some luck at first, making about $30 a day but I was way over my head. My luck didn&#039;t last long and I had to rethink my strategy. <br>
 <br>
Day trading involves A LOT of commissions to the broker. With all the commissions deducted from each trade, you&#039;ll be lucky if you only lose half your money. <br>
 <br>
I would just day trade using Yahoo! Finance. Open a stimulation account, give yourself $100 worth of fake money and play it in the stimulation format. You&#039;ll see what I mean by losing money every easily. <br>

Good luck.

         This article has some valuable information comparing both alternatives: <br>
 <br>
http://invest-faq***/cbc/mfund-vs-stocks.html <br>
 <br>
My thought is that if you have to ask which is better, then it&#039;s not a foregone conclusion that you can beat the market investing in individual stocks.  If that&#039;s the case, then you should go with an index fund that tracks the market average... <br>
 <br>
Why? <br>
 <br>
Because most mutual funds (70-80%) underperform the market average. <br>
 <br>
So here&#039;s another question: <br>
 <br>
Should you invest in index funds or actively managed mutual funds? <br>
 <br>
This article provides a good answer: <br>
 <br>
http://20somethingfinance***/blog/2008/03/21/should-i-invest-in-index-funds-or-managed-mutual-funds/ <br>
 <br>
I hope this helps, and good luck to you.  Congratulations on maxing out your 401k!
        </p> Only you can really answer that.  It really depends upon what you are comfortable with. <br>
 <br>
Personally, I have 2 Roth IRAs.  One Roth is my &quot;aggressive&quot; Roth.  It&#039;s mostly invested in individual stocks.  My other one is my &quot;conservative&quot; Roth.  It&#039;s invested in mutual funds.
        </p> Have you heard of exchange traded funds (known as ETFs)? They are considerably less expensive than mutual funds and they have the flexibility of stocks. They also outperform mutual funds 90% of the time over 5 years.  <br>
 <br>
I suggest you start with SPY, DIA, or QQQQ. All of these mirror the major markets and are MORE diversified than mutual funds. Once you figure out what they do, you can move on to ETF&#039;s that invest in sectors, overseas, and comodities. You will need to open an account with a brokerage firm (it is free) like Scottrade. Trades are $7 rather than paying the mutual fund company day after day and year after year.  <br>
 <br>
Know what you are doing before you invest. In my opinion mutual funds are obsolete, expensive and detrimental to my retirement.
        </p> It&#039;s bad
        </p> most people should just do a diversified portfolio of index funds and re balance every year.
        </p> If you have particular companies you know you want to have long term investments in I would go with stocks.  Mutual funds are good to diversify but also tend to have more fees.  It may be cheaper to find a mutual fund you like and model it by investing in their top portions.  Although some mutual funds invest in more than stocks; some have bonds, commodities, and currency.
        </p> If your 401k is already vested in mutual funds, you should consider diversifying into individual stocks.  That&#039;s trickier because you have to be sure you&#039;re not buying stocks already held in the mutual funds. <br>
 <br>
That also assumes that you&#039;re comfortable stock picking.  If you aren&#039;t then you should continue with the mutual funds. <br>
 <br>
Be careful that you aren&#039;t also over-saving for retirment.  I also have a 401k and fully funded Roth IRA but, that&#039;s because I&#039;m cautious - probably to a fault.
        </p> An individual investor is at big disadvantage when trying to buy individual stocks. Don&#039;t believe the infomercials that tout how great it is to &quot;take charge&quot; of your own investments and how their fancy software will enable you to know what to buy and when to sell. There are thousands of &quot;professional&quot; investors managing trust, endowments, hedge funds, and mutual funds. They have sophisticated computer systems and the best access. They also get the best execution of their trades. Most of them can&#039;t beat the market.  <br>
 <br>
There are no reliable &quot;blue chips&quot;. GM, GE, AIG, Bank America, Sears, were recently considered blue chip stocks. You used to be able to buy some of these, hold them and collect the dividend. No more - they crashed and cut their dividends.  <br>
 <br>
As you nest egg grows - you will be responsible to manage a lot of money and are more likely to make &quot;rookie&quot; mistakes like holding on too long when a stock starts to fall. <br>
 <br>
I would suggest reading The Boglehead&#039;s Guide to Investing. It is written in layman&#039;s terms and will give you a comfort level with investing in low cost index funds. Basically, what an individual investor can control is allocation (between stocks, bonds and cash) and cost. I was in the Financial Services Industry for more than 30 years and it helped change my mind as to how to invest. <br>
 <br>
Good Luck
        </p> You should invest in mutual funds because you are investing for the long term and you need to reduce the risks that investing in individual stocks poses.
        </p> mutual funds INVEST IN STOCKS - unless you are very knowledgeable about researching individual stocks, you&#039;re better off with a mutual fund
         Initially, I would invest in mutual funds.  As your Roth IRA grows (say in five years or so), you might want to invest PART of it in good quality stocks.  But stay diversified.
        </p> Gold!  <br>
