</script><p> There are some stats available in the Financial Times. For example you can see what the FTSE100 yields (I think it might be prospective 3.7%) So that would give £3-£4k. Of course you could devise your portfolio to include only the high yielding stocks (around 6%) or even spread the funds between equities and bonds to get about 7-8%.

</script><p> Depends but 3k - 5k is probably about right.  Bear in mind inflation would eat up about 2k in purchasing power in the same time span, though you have to pay capital gains taxes on the entire 3k - 5k.  In other words, you&#039;d just barely stay ahead of inflation. <br>
 <br>
When the economy picks up, this will hopefully improve a bit. <br>
 <br>
Edit:  Sorry, I just noticed you asked this in UK YA.  Maybe your tax law is different on this matter than the US tax law on it.  So disregard the part about capital gains.
