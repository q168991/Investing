<h1>How to begin investing my money?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am new to investing and have only a little bit of money to invest ($1000).  I have been reading and researching different investments, but there is so much information that I am getting bogged down.  Does anyone have any advice about what investments would be good or what brokers are good to use for a newbie?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> First off invest in your retirement first and formost. If you put in 4k into a roth ira now, in 33 years averaging 10% (the return of the markets since 1926) you&#039;ll have a cool million dollars tax free and you can also add to that $4k each year to increase that million dollars in retirement. You can open up accts with no fees or loads with Fidelity or Vanguard and very low management fees. Index mutual funds or managed funds are your best bet, just check the history of the fund and look at the 10 yr avg returns on the funds, instread of the 1, 3, or 5 yr.
        </p> Hi, I just developed a business plan and organize my friends to participate. The thing is that preliminary projections show 695% just as dividends in the next 5 years. And anyone can profit from it without any knowledge and with as little as $200. Contact me on vaicekauskaslukas@yahoo.co.uk and I will send a detailed plan.
        </p> We are headed for  hyperinflation, in my opinion. I would start buying physical gold and silver and store that since it is expected to skyrocket. Also, during those tough economic  times, there will be food shortages so store up  enough for you and your family to last 12-18 months. If you can buy more food, that would be better because you could use that as a bartering tool for gold  and silver. Finally, get a weapon to protect you, yourself, and your house as thieves will attempt to steal from you and try to kill you and your family. This is how I invest most of my money. I also have some of my investments in short term CD&#039;s and savings just in case of deflation. It&#039;s important to have inflationary friendly assets as well as deflationary friendly assets. Have a diversed financial portfolio.
        </p> you and use etrade or scottrade your self it is simple and looking for safe companies that are not going anywhere.
