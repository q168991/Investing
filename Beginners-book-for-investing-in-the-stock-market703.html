<h1>Beginners book for investing in the stock market?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am a recent high school graduate and would like to experiment with stocks and investments. Assume I know minimal on the subject and looking for a book that can provide knowledge on stock rhetoric such as &amp;#39;mutual funds&amp;#39;, etc. 

Thanks<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Start with some basic books to teach you the fundamentals. Two excellent reads are The Complete Idiot&#039;s Guide to Investing, and Investing for Dummies. You can probably find them in your local library. Before doing anything, make sure you have enough in savings in case things go south for at least 6 months if you’re on your own. Also make sure you have <br>
bad debt like credit cards paid off first.  <br>
You need to learn also some important concepts in investing, such as dollar-cost averaging and compound interest - two of your best friends to make money for the future. <br>
Also you need to think of what you are investing for exactly.

</script><p> I would check out Matthew Tagliani&#039;s The Practical Guide to Wall Street: Equities and Derivatives (http://***bestbooksontrading***/2011/08/practical-guide-to-wall-street-equities.html) for what you are looking for.   <br>
 <br>
This book is a good walk into what different financial products are.  It covers equities, ETFs, futures, swaps and options.  It also limits its&#039; coverage to primarily equity (stock) related topics so as not to confuse a beginner with all of the nuances of the currency markets (FX) or fixed income markets (debt).  If you&#039;re looking to pick up the lingo that will help you understand the market this concentrated approach is a really good place to start.  As a plus, it&#039;s currently used in some Wall Street training classes so you know it&#039;s not just theoretical stuff. <br>
 <br>
With that said, I can&#039;t stress enough, you can&#039;t really trade stocks well without either being a PhD in math or physics or have some understanding of accounting.  As a little accounting is easier to pick up than a PhD, picking up a good introductory accounting text (they don&#039;t really change so any will do) off amazon wouldn&#039;t be a bad idea either.
        </p> I&#039;ve said this before. Investing isn&#039;t about understanding how the stock market operates, it&#039;s about understanding how the economy works in general. Most large companies are macro, and are affected by most economic incidents within a country. So the first step to investing is learning economics.
        </p> Larry Swedroe has a number of excellent books, most notably, his &quot;The Only Guide You&#039;ll Ever Need&quot; series. I have read each of his books numerous times and highly recommend him.  <br>
He recommends low-cost investments and his latest book, The Quest for Alpha, is full of all the evidence you will ever need proving that stock picking and active management is prone to failure. <br>
At your library, but support the author if you have the money.
        </p> Would recommend Investopedia*** to start. Its the encyclopedia of Investments and has lot of material for a novice. <br>
 <br>
You can also checkout some of the books given at InvestorZclub.
        </p> &quot; Investing for Dummies &quot; is a good book that describes the basics of trading in stocks.  This will give you a foundation upon which to build up further knowledge. <br>
 <br>
You can borrow it from your local library.
        </p> I really recommend books about Buffett
