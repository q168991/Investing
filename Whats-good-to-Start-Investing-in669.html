<h1>Whats good to Start Investing in?</h1>
<div class="answer">ok folks i think its about time i started investing a bit of my money, im looking to start of with £500 and build on it so heres the thing

-what do i invest in? ive read countless reports on gold both good and bad, for instance gold is reaching its peak value and its not worth it

-ive heard about these CD&amp;#39;s? and ISA&amp;#39;s, but i dont trust banks, id rather something stable, and i dont really care about the interest, it only really varies in 1-3pct anyway, and unless your investing thousands each year you wont see much of a difference

-preferably i would like something i can keep topping up, but cant withdraw, for example a 5year fixed term

any solutions? 
P.S. i would rather it not be in a bank, i want it to be hidden away as much as possible as number 1, i have a few debts to pay of and dont want my savings or investment being affected and number 2 i am a student, so i dont want to take any &amp;#39;risks&amp;#39; on the stock market and losing my investment

something very secure :D

</script><p> the only actual answer nicely worth a darn so a techniques given became from Suzy. Apple is in hardship over the inventory suggestions. actual belongings is overestimated and due for a tricky touchdown (relatively with the valuables taxes going up). Gold is in basic terms for an inflation hedge. selection means is a humorous tale that no person is taking heavily regardless of that fool Gore winning an Oscar final night (in all probability a rigged win because of the fact over a million/2 of Hollywood is a commiecrat). well-being care sector is in hardship with the commiecrats working the asylum in Washington now. even though it takes money to make money.
        </p> Since you&#039;re new to investing, I suggest you open up a test account (that trades with fake money). If you jump right in with real money, you&#039;ll be creamed.
        </p> Best to paper trade for at least 6 months to get the feel for how stocks move and when.
        </p> There are many ways of investments like share market, mutual funds and it will depend on you.  I think your investment must be safe invest.
        </p> Use it to pay off the debt with the highest interest rate.
