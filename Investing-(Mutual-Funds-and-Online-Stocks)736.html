Before you put a penny into any fund make sure you totally understand Mutual Funds.  There will be a time when the market will drop, everyone on TV will be saying that the stock market is crashing &amp; you&#039;ll lose 20% - 60% or more..... everyone will be telling you to get out of the market as fast as you can...... &quot;this time is different&quot; will be what everyone says.... if you read the books... you&#039;ll know that you shouldn&#039;t leave the fund(s)..... just wait out the bad times &amp; you&#039;ll be fine.

</script><p> Hey there, <br>
Penny stocks, also known as cent stocks in some countries, are common shares of small public companies that trade at low prices per share. They are notoriously risky but if you follow a special method I&#039;ve learned you can earn good money at almost no risk. This is the site I use: http://pennystocks.toptips.org <br>
 <br>
I definitely recommend subscribing to this site in particular. Very good research, quality stocks. I was a bit weary of penny stocks from all the bad hype they receive but this guy is pretty legit. He&#039;s put my mind at ease with a lot of the fears I&#039;ve had. I especially like that he doesn&#039;t send out announcements left and right. I&#039;ve signed up for other websites that fill my in-box with one company after the other. I don&#039;t know where to even start with so many choices in front of me! Nathan sends me one idea a week and that&#039;s all I need. Working so many hours during the week leaves me with very little time when I get home to start doing tons of penny stock research. I&#039;m always eager to see what Nathan&#039;s next suggestion is each Friday and I love having time on the weekend to do my research.  <br>
 <br>
As said above if you want to make money with penny stocks you have to follow some proven methods. This one in my opinion is the best: http://pennystocks.toptips.org <br>
Regards
        </p> Get a book such as   <br>
Investing for Dummies <br>
Investing Made Easy. <br>
Available at bookstores.  Best $20 you will ever spend. <br>
A book that you will go back to many times in your life time.
        </p> I&#039;d read MorningStar and check out Janus.  I&#039;d also look into socially responsible mutual funds that do well and allows you sleep at night knowing you&#039;re not polluting the planet or making a profit from liquor sales in poor neighborhoods or something.  I&#039;d avoid day trading which is for suckers.  Buy low and sell high.  Also buy low P/E.  And don&#039;t forget to hedge your dollars not with gold but real estate, commodities, and oil.
