<h1>Brief explaination about investing in the stock market! [16 years old]?</h1>
<div class="answer">Im 16 years old. I frequently hear about the stock market, people buying stocks, selling, ect. Well I want to know what this really is and how it REALLY works. I was told that you can only invest in the stock market at the age of 18, but I want to research and learn about stocks now.

Just tell me a brief explaination of the stock market and how it works thats it. If you mention acroynms, please tell me what they mean. Assume I know nothing about business and finance.

I would also like some sources where I can learn these things at a basic level. 

Thank you for helping me out  =]<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Let&#039;s start with the basics. <br>
 <br>
Every day you encounter different companies.  You might drink a soda from Pepsi or Coca Cola.  The clothes you wear were made by one company and sold by another.  If you buy a pizza from the local pizza shop, you&#039;re buying from a local business. <br>
 <br>
Most businesses are organized as one of four types of entities: sole proprietorships, partnerships, limited liability companies, or corporations.   <br>
 <br>
A sole proprietorship is simply one person doing business.  For example, that pizza shop might be owned by one guy who is simply doing business in his own name.  It&#039;s simple, but he is personally liable for any debts the business incurs. <br>
 <br>
A partnership is two or more people who own and operate a business.  Let&#039;s say the pizza shop was started by two friends. They are partners in business and each of them is fully liable for he debts of that business. <br>
 <br>
Sole proprietorships and partnerships are great if the business is small and partners get along, but they are not practical for operating many businesses especially if you want to attract investors.   <br>
 <br>
Now, let&#039;s pretend the pizza shop wants to become a national pizza chain.  They have great ideas, great pizza, but they do not have enough money to open multiple locations.  To get the needed money they might look for other people to invest money in the business.  If those investors want to own a part of that business, a sole proprietorship and partnership won&#039;t work because those investors will not want to be personally liable for the debts of the business.  They&#039;re already risking the money the invested, but they do not want to be exposed to further liability beyond their investment. <br>
 <br>
A Limited Liability Company works much like a partnership, but protects investors by shielding them from liability.  Let&#039;s say our pizza company is formed as an LLC and later makes a lot of pizza with ingredients that is tainted with eColi, making many people sick and perhaps causing a few deaths.  Those people and their families can sue the business, which is now an LLC, but they may not sue the individual investors.  An LLC is nice structure for a business when you have a small group of investors who want to be protected against such liability. <br>
 <br>
A corporation provides the same type of limited liability protection for investors, but unlike the LLC it issues shares of stock.  The stock represents a fractional ownership interest.  Shares of stock can be issued to each investor, who may then sell those shares to other people.  This makes it relatively easy for an investor to profit from their investment.   <br>
 <br>
There are many, many corporations out there.  Small, medium, and large.  Most are &quot;privately held,&quot; which means that their shares are not offered to the public for sale.  Some corporations are &quot;publicly listed&quot; on one of the world&#039;s stock exchanges.  This means that anyone can buy or sell shares in the company at any time when the exchange is open. <br>
 <br>
Consider Apple, Inc.  It used to be a company operated by Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak out of their garage.  They were partners.  They built a small kit that other could assemble into a computer.  They wanted to attract investors so they incorporated their companying, creating Apple Computer, Inc.  Shares of the company were sold to investors in exchange for money that could be used to develop the Apple II computer.  The company later went public with those shares of stock being sold on the NASDAQ stock exchange. <br>
 <br>
Today, Apple Computer, Inc., has changed its name to Apple, Inc., to reflect the fact that it makes other products in addition to computers.  You and I can buy, or sell, shares of the company.   <br>
 <br>
When we buy shares of stock we become owners in the company.  You have rights as a share holder, including the right to vote on who will run the company.   <br>
 <br>
A corporation may choose to distribute some of its profits to share holders.  This is called a dividend. <br>
 <br>
As a company increases its profits, the shares of stock become more valuable.  Stock prices reflect the expectations of the stock market as a whole as to whether the company will continue to grow its earnings, whether earnings growth will slow or accelerate, or whether the company&#039;s earnings may decline. <br>
 <br>
So, when you buy stock on a stock exchange you are not buying it from the corporation.  You are buying shares that some other investor is selling.  You&#039;re buying because you hope to see those shares rise in value.  The person selling may be taking profits, in need of the cash, cutting their losses, etc.   <br>
 <br>
The &quot;stock market&quot; is a collection of multiple exchanges where shares in corporate business are bought and sold.  The people doing the buying and selling are individual investors like you and me, or large institutional investors like a mutual fund or a pension plan.   <br>
 <br>
So, as a young investor you can save some money and then open a brokerage account with your choice of brokerages.  Examples would include TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab, Scott Trade.  There are many, many others.  You will place orders to buy or sell with your broker, who will then execute those orders on your behalf on one of several exchanges.  The broker then reports back to you, confirming that your order was filled and at what price it was filled.  The broker takes a small fee for that service, called a commission. <br>
 <br>
You will make money from any shares of stock you own if they go up in value.  You can also make money if the company pays a dividend to its share holders.  If the share price falls, you will lose money.  If the company goes bankrupt, you will likely lose your full investment.  But, because you own shares in a corporation, you cannot lose more than your investment. <br>
 <br>
Some people, like Warren Buffet, are long term investors.  They buy shares in a company after researching and concluding that it is a solid company with good prospects for sustained earnings growth.  They intend to hold their shares indefinitely or for a number of years at a minimum. <br>
 <br>
Other people are short-term traders.  They are less concerned with the company&#039;s long term prospects.  They look for a company&#039;s stock price to begin making a move in one direction or the other.  If the stock price starts moving higher they might buy shares and then sell then a short while later, capturing a small profit if the stock kept moving in the anticipated upward direction.   <br>
 <br>
If the stock&#039;s share price starts falling, they might borrow shares of the stock from their broker and then sell them.  They&#039;ll buy additional shares later at a lower price and return them to their broker from whom they borrowed them.  The difference in the price when they sold the borrowed shares and when they bought the shares back will constitute their profit or loss.  This is known as &quot;short selling&quot; or &quot;selling short.&quot; <br>
 <br>
Obviously, I&#039;ve but scratched the surface on this subject.  There is a great deal to learn, but because you are young you have nothing but time.   <br>
 <br>
Start by picking up some good books on the subject of investing and the stock market.  Successful investors and traders are constantly reading, studying, and learning.  There is a great deal of information on the Internet, too.  I&#039;ve listed a couple suggested resources for you to consider. <br>
 <br>
Good luck to you!

</script><p> How the stock market works, is that you can either buy one stock, or a group of mutual funds. You invest a certain amount of money into this stock. For example, let&#039;s say you invest $100.00 into the stock. <br>
 <br>
You probably have heard, &quot;My stock has gained, or my stock has lost points.&quot; That means that either the company doesn&#039;t have enough sales, or they had a bad investment, etc.  <br>
 <br>
Usually, if your stock goes down, it&#039;s going to come back up eventually. However, if you see a stock that is going downhill for more than a set period of time, you should sell it. <br>
 <br>
How do you sell a stock? Well, there&#039;s something called the Stock Exchange. This is a place where you can sell a stock. For example, Wall Street in New York City is a stock exchange area, where you can sell your stock. <br>
 <br>
Many adults who have more money invest in having a company take care of their stocks. What they do is make sure that your stock is doing well. They buy stocks for you, because they are probably more experienced then you are. Then, if they see that it&#039;s doing bad, they will have an agent go down to the Stock Exchange and sell it. <br>
 <br>
How much money do you makewhen you sell it? It depends how much it went up or down. If you bought your stock at 5 points, and it went up to 10 points, then you will receive $200.00, because it doubled, and you invested in it when it was only $100.00. Most stocks do not double until later years. <br>
 <br>
I hope I helped out!
        </p> I&#039;ve been trading for over 5 years, successfully too.  And I am now about to get into technical trading.  So, I bought a book called, &quot;The Complete Idiot&#039;s Guide to Trading Stocks Like A Pro&quot;.   I suggest you buy it.  It costs 19.95 at most book stores.  I like the way it explains things very simply.     <br>
 <br>
Email me for more info if you wish.  By the way, it&#039;s great that you will have 2 years to wait and to study stock trading before you can ever actually trade.   Most people should do that too, but they don&#039;t, and many lose their money.  So, I&#039;m really glad you want to learn this now.  It&#039;s a great way to make a living.
