</script><p> If you want &quot;the most bang for your buck&quot; then what you are saying is you want to gamble. Vegas is that answer. Black or red, double or lose it all - and no commission. <br>
 <br>
If you want to become an investor, you will need patience, and strategy. <br>
 <br>
For most people, I would be looking at a Roth IRA and dollar cost averaging every month or bi-monthly into the S&amp;P 500 Index then wait 15 years+.

</script><p> Since you&#039;re still very young and seems to want to do long-term investing, I would suggest you put $3000 of your savings in a Roth IRA investing in T. Rowe Price 2040 Target Fund, which would automatically allocate your money to stocks, bonds, and short-term supersafe investment according to years until retirement.  <br>
 <br>
I would then put another $3000 in stock account and buy SPY (maybe 30 shares or so). SPY is the symbol for a ETF that tracks S&amp;P 500 index, which consists of the best 500 companies in US.  <br>
 <br>
I would then wait until next year to put another $3000 into the Roth IRA and invest in a global mutual fund. Make sure you specify this $3000 to 2009 contribution.  <br>
 <br>
I would put the rest in a savings or short-term CD account as emergency money. <br>
 <br>
The good thing about Roth IRA is that any gains in the account are tax-free. 
        </p> Right now is a good time to leave a lot in cash and start investing a little at a time.  I would suggest looking at broad index ETFs like QQQQ, VTI, VWO, PHB, BND, SPY  <br>
 <br>
But like I said don&#039;t jump in with both feet and make sure you can explain what you are investing in before you put even 1 dollar towards it. <br>
 <br>
It would probably be a good idea to dump your cash into whichever brokerage account you plan on using but keep a few thousand back in a money market account at your bank or credit union as an emergency fund. 
        </p> Dear 20 years old young man I found your question on the net, I am a father of 3  son of 22, dauther of 20, and youngest son of 18, they are all in Malta, I am in Bulgaria as I made a huge investment here and I am very happy with what i done, as a young man with this cash I can say that you are very smart to manage to save these money. Today life is not easy but we have to look a head no atter what, my answer to you is that you must keep this money in a bank with a good interes and continue saving , unless you dont find a good opportunity to invest in a commercial outlet as for sure you will need more money to start to invest. keep taking care of your money and be carefull how to spend your money one day you be rich Best regards Emanuel Ellul
        </p> Open an acct with Vanguard. <br>
 <br>
Put half into a money market and half into a global stock fund. <br>
When Dow goes above 10,000 or below 7000 put the other half into the same fund.  If you are working and can qualify for an IRA of some kind, it would be better to open an IRA with Vanguard than a regular account and then maximize how much you put into it.
        </p> This is the right time to invest for long term. As the stock prices are really low and you can find good bargains. <br>
 <br>
According to a many researches if you put your money into an index fund for say around 10years+ it would give very good returns (A quick look at NASDAQ index http://finance.google***/finance?q=INDE... would show an overall growth. <br>
 <br>
But before you start doing investing please think of the time horizon and risk you can take with this money. Also, wherever you put your money please look into basics like how a Stock/Mutual Fund/Gold etc. increases in value and gives you returns. This would help avoid speculative buying. Simply ... understand basics of your investment. <br>
 <br>
Please remember:  These are tough times ... and you might risk loosing a proportion of money initially in Stocks. <br>

        </p> IF it is long term and you qualify put it in a Roth Ira backed by some kind of index fund.  Put half as a 2008 contribution and the other as a 2009 contribution.

        </p> I would love to talk to you about a great opportunity with a web based job site (much like monster or Ladders, but offering much more), a social networking site and an energy drink. Our shares are very low at this point. Let me know if you would like to talk
        </p> I can give you some guidance and take the headache off your head. I work as a broker with a broker-dealer 20 minutes north of Orlando, Florida. Shoot me an email @ my personal: Aalidina04a@yahoo***.

        </p> Buy oversold stocks and sell them for profit over and over again. This is what I do for consistent profits. if you do this with good timimg you will triple your $10,000 easy.
