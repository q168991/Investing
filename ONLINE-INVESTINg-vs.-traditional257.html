</script><p> no limit. I would rather trade online, I can sit there with my tdameritrade account open and click buy or sell and it happens mostly within 60 seconds. Traditional, you have to call your broker and hope you catch him.  <br>
 I used traditional to start with and only made a little. I started with tdameritrade with 2 grand and turned it into 186 thou by the end of the year doing daytrades. <br>
Limit would be your eagerness to learn and ability to keep turning each and every dollar you make. dont profit 1000 off a sale and pocket 800 and reinvest the 200. set a goal and keep to it. commit yourself to a time table that you wont touch any money made for so long so you can keep turning that money. <br>
The trick with daytrading I found is I dont care how bad the market is, if you find a stock that trades serious volume in a trading say, you can make money during that trading day. <br>
A tip... <br>
goto like yahoo finance and look up a few charts for several stocks. Look ONLY at the current day. no 5 day look or anything. Pay attention to that one day chart. Then look closely at the times those stocks and are down. remember high volume stocks only. You should be able to figure it out from there. <br>
ANother thing. It takes money to make money.

</script><p> You can definitely make a million online.  <br>
 <br>
I prefer online because it is efficient, low transaction costs, and I have instant access to real time quotes and my current balances. Most brokerages offer a wealth of trading information regardless if you enter 1 trade a year or a hundred. <br>
 <br>
I invest rather than day trade, but I still always choose online.
        </p> trade online is more cheaper
