</script><p> First you should know what your options for investing are.  <br>
 <br>
If you don&#039;t have a good deal of money (in the thousands), you shouldn&#039;t invest in stocks because you won&#039;t be able to diversify your holdings enough - you need a well balanced portfolio that fits your goals and spreads out risk. <br>
 <br>
Usually mutual funds are the most convenient and practical way for most people to invest in the stock market, with fund minimums starting around $1000 for funds like Vanguard STAR (VGSTX, a fund for beginning investors), and most of them being around $3,000 (and certainly going past that). <br>
 <br>
Another option is exchange-traded funds. They are baskets of stocks that are traded like stocks, and have lower expense ratios (the percentage that the fund company takes from your total return every year, usually under 1%) than mutual funds. ETFs don&#039;t have minimums. <br>
 <br>
Here&#039;s the &quot;Learn&quot; section of a very reputable securities analysis company called Morningstar - they make lots of books about investing which you might want to check out as well. <br>
 <br>
http://***morningstar***/Cover/Worksho... <br>
 <br>
If you take a lot of tests there (and do well on them), you can actually send for a free book. Of course, you&#039;ll be on their mailing list after that. <br>
 <br>
http://***investopedia*** is also another great website for reading about all the different options available to you. <br>
 <br>
As for the brokers that you will have to buy your investments through (unless you buy it straight from a fund company like Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, or Fidelity), you have quite a few choices. The more affordable, while still easy-to-use brokers are Scottrade and TradeKing, while E-Trade and TDAmeritrade are very well-established and user-friendly but more costly brokers. <br>
 <br>
Hope I helped.

</script><p> All the above answers are NOT practical, if you don&#039;t have a lot of $$.  Paying $17 per trade in sharebuilder is not a viable option for you. <br>
 <br>
Similarly paying $3000 initial deposit with Vanguard Mutual funds is again ruled out...But, if you&#039;re interested in Investing AND don&#039;t have lotta of $$$, mutual fund is the way to go. <br>
 <br>
Can you muster $25...atleast ...per month?  If you answer yes...goto http://***troweprice*** <br>
 <br>
Explore the T.Rowe Price Mutual Funds.  This is an established fund company and DOES NOT REQUIRE $3000 minimum to open a fund account.  Only requirement is you need to COMMIT to invest atleast $25 every month ( it&#039;s called Automatic Investment Plan or something like that ).  Call the Toll free number to talk with someone at T.Rowe Price. <br>
 <br>
I think this is your best bet...Don&#039;t get burned by investing in Stocks directly to begin with atleast. <br>
 <br>
Good Luck
        </p> Do you have at least $3,000? If so go to vanguard*** and invest in an Index 500 fund. That&#039;s the S&amp;P 500. If you don&#039;t need the money for a long time, make it an I.R.A. account so all the profits are deferred. The first thing you should do to accumulate a large amount of funds over time is invest in your 401K at work as iciemonster said. I.R.A. second and personal third. This is what&#039;s known as the 8th wonder of the world. Good luck
        </p> I have a great investment.  Go into the bathroom and look in the mirror.  There is a great investment.   <br>
 <br>
Buy some books or take a few college courses - improve your own value to yourself and to employers or clients.  This investment offers the best return and you control 100% of that company. <br>
 <br>
Good Luck
        </p> I suggest you to open a brokerage account at Scottrade and invest in the Stock Market with the help of a Portfolio Manager like myself or a Financial Advisor. <br>

        </p> I used share builder.  Bought some stock for a 17 dollar trade fee.  Buy a new stock that is just coming out called an IPO.  I bought Burger King when it first went on the stock market and made a dollar per share.

        </p> try your 401k program if your workplace offers it
