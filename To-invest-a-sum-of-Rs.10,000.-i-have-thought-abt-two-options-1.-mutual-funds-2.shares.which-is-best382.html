</script><p> Hi, Lokking at safety mutual funds are good but only for long term investment,Shares are the best if you know which one to buy Fee for mutual funds can be high especially for short term investment. in mutual funds the risk is very less so is the profit. but I can tell you one way to ripe maximum profit, assuming you have a Trading-D-mat account Max. Tenure .....its up to you Min. depending on the market as market is highly bullish these days may cross 13000, you said you have 10k to invest devide it in 6 Equal parts and select any Bluechip Script ranging between 200 to 400 Rs and start buying  in six easy installment this will average profit and loss as well Example <br>
 <br>
Fist day Buy  <br>
 <br>
XYZ Ltd. prise as on day 200   buy 8 shares 1600 <br>
 <br>
next 15 days price 195              buy 8 shares 1560 <br>
 <br>
next 15 days price 185             buy 8 shares 1480 <br>
 <br>
next 15 days price 195              buy 8 shares 1560 <br>
 <br>
next 15 days price 205              buy 8 shares 1640 <br>
 <br>
next 15 days price 230              buy 8 shares 1840 <br>
 <br>
Average Buy rate is     Aprx. 201 No. of shares Baught are 48 total investment 9680/- sell at these level profit would be 1360 <br>
 <br>
and now fix the target to sell like if u decide the target of 300 rs dont sell untill u sell at 300 and while selling use the same funda which u used to buy <br>
 <br>
for further details get back to me  <br>

</script><p> Mutual funds take less risk compare to shares. But for a 6 month investments, mutual funds might not gain a lot as this is better for long term investments.
        </p> Rs10,000/- is Nothing, Before comming to stock market check have u invested these1) Gold, Silver, 2)Insurance 3) Bank F.D or R.D 4) Bonds 5) NSc&#039;s, 6) Real Estate If u have done all this, I mean proportnatley, Then start with Mutual Fund. <br>
 <br>
When U want  to invest in shares invest as an investor I mean long term u can buy even 2 infosys share and hold for long time. With Rs10,000/ if u enter share market as specu;ator, chances are u wipe out and get  thrown out.
        </p> Mutual fund is the best. Because it is professionally managed. If you invest in shares risk is involved.  <br>

typically mutual fund companies also invest in the share market using an aggression strategy that you choose. the higher the risks - the higher the returns. <br>
 <br>
In share market, you are on your own. You win big, you lose big. <br>
Follow the strategy in blackjack/poker: bet small but keep betting longer. Exit when you are feeling lucky.
        </p> Mutual funds
        </p> how much ever money u wish to invest always consider your risk apetite. mutual funds are for risk averse people.u got to wait to reap profits in MF. now that share market is really doing well why don&#039;t u go for purchasing some blue chip company scrips if u are planning for more than a year of investment.
        </p> Shares are better if you know which one to buy. Fee for mutual funds can be high especially for short term investment.
        </p> I am a Technical Analyst and my belief is that the trend is highly bullish in future. I would prefer investing in good stocks on my own instead of giving it blindfoldingly in mutual fund&#039;s care.
        </p> Mutual funds is a better option..  <br>
Go for any equity MF IPO&#039;s.. they will give u a 20-30% returns

         Share= high risk high return <br>
Mutual Fund= Moderate risk moderate return
        </p> go for an existing mutual fund scheme. to evaluate - see the performance of fund and entry-exit load with investment avenues. Better to go for diversified equity scheme
        </p> See .....in mutual funds the risk is very less so is the profit.While its better if u enter in stock market and trade(TRADE)in bluechip (Reputed) companies and u can get handsome returns.Thanks.
        </p> Love
        </p> hi vinod. u have both the good options. but today the best yield is in futures and that too copper.u know that same 10,000/- has given yield of Rs.28,800/- that too in just 6 months.check it out with good futures person or fa.good luck.
        </p> mutual funds
        </p> mutual fund
