</script><p> a quick way of making money is to get it in to a high interest savings account - it will start earning from the day you put it in there and there is almost no risk to your money (no investment is 100% risk free!). <br>
 <br>
If you are in the UK, make sure you are making the most of your tax free savings allowance, the ISA. <br>
 <br>
You may want to look at longer term guaranteed investments if you don&#039;t want to access the money for 3-5 years. <br>
 <br>
Don&#039;t invest in the stock market, and don&#039;t buy premium bonds - investing in the markets is anything but risk free and premium bonds won&#039;t earn you money, they might!
        </p> That way doesn&#039;t exist.  You either have to cope with safe non-inflation-proof accounts, or take risks and try to beat inflation.  Your best bet is one of these investment schemes that guarantees the return of your outlay at a certain date - you may then  lose due to inflation, but can receive the cash you put in. If you&#039;re in the UK what about premium bonds?  You&#039;re always guaranteed your outlay, and could win.  Government bonds?  You would have to tie up your money for a set period.  Good luck.  When we are penniless we worry (I&#039;ve been there), but when have a little bit we still worry.
        </p> Investing in real estate is no good right now, values are over inflated and you&#039;d be throwing money away. Your best bet is in stocks or with mutual funds if you&#039;re looking to see the best possible returns. That top10 traders site the other user suggested is also a great way to test the waters if you want to try individual stocks. I use it myself! If you&#039;re not ready, try a regular CD or money market account to park the cash in before you make bigger plans. Discover Bank and eTrade have some of the highest rates with those too!
        </p> Slow down. Often the fastest way to make money turns out to be the fastest way to lose your money. <br>
 <br>
If I were you, I would place your money in a high yield savings account (e.g., Emigrant Direct) and let it earn interest while you educate yourself about investing and the various risks associated with different investments.  <br>
 <br>
Never invest more than you can comfortably afford to lose, and don&#039;t put all of your eggs in one basket. <br>
 <br>
Good luck!
        </p> It really depends on how quickly you need to generate a return and how quickly you will need the money. The safest fastest return would be t-bills (government bonds) or bonds, but these items traditionally under-perform, however, there is no risk in loosing the money you invest (unless it is a municipality bond in California or Florida). Also how liquid of an asset you need is important (how quickly it can be converted to cash), because t-bills and whatnot are not as liquid as a CD.
        </p> Government I bonds are perhaps the lowest risk but if you really want to do something worthwhile with it and dont absolutely need the money to buy something with in the next year or 3 why not go and talk to a brokerage like Fidelity that can help you plan out a diversified portfolio that would meet your risk/reward criteria.
        </p> If you want no risk suggest buying £25,000 of premium bonds in one block then just watch the winnings start to arrive, alternatively invest in a safe fixed interest savings account. <br>
 <br>
Really anything you invest in will have some risk.
        </p> Faircent is the answer !
        </p> Before doing anything , just invest your hard earned $77.

         US Government Bonds is as close to no-risk as you can get.  Afterall, if the government defaults, the least of your worries will be your paper wealth.
