<h1>What would be good to invest 1k into?</h1>
<div class="answer">I don&amp;#39;t know a lot about stocks and mutual funds to be honest BUT I think I&amp;#39;d like to take a gamble on 1k. I have quite a bit of money saved up in my TFSA, no debt, and I live at home with my mom. Whats a good investment option that I could try?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

If you are over 18, which you must be to invest on the Stock market, look at the share price of the small banks that have come through the G.F.C. If you are in the US, than I can&#039;t give you names, but  research is the name of the game in investing so the banks would be a good place to start. Look at the share prices in the papers, and see how they have been going over the past year, and then look them up on-line to see how they have recovered for the past three months.

</script><p> Investing is so much fun! And it is not that much of a gamble, if you play the game right. As long as a company does not go bankrupt, its stock will always have value. And as long as you choose the right company (preferrably a large, American, dividend paying one), the company probably never will go bankrupt. Anyways, before I ramble on too much more... here are some companies that usually do pretty well: <br>
1. Procter and Gamble (PG) <br>
2. Pepsi (PEP) and Coke (KO) <br>
3. Oil companies (XOM, COP, CVX, BP, TOT) <br>
4. Intel (INTC) and Microsoft (MSFT) <br>
 <br>
These guys all pay a nice and safe dividend. This means they give you money every quarter in the form of cash or additional stock just for owning shares of the stock. You should reinvest this dividend to maximize your returns over the long term. <br>
 <br>
Warning though: You can never be 100% sure you beat the market. 99% is usually as good as it gets. <br>
 <br>
Try looking for stocks on your own. Pick companies that you know and understand as well as have dividends so that your wealth grows no matter what. Well, almost no matter what. <br>
 <br>
Good luck man!

        </p> Stocks and let me tell you why. They are at there all time low right now and they will start bouncing back with the economy. Shares that costed 5 dollars a share, are down to pennies on the dollar. If you want to keep making money then i would invest in stocks. A great stock to invest in would be cardio genics. The Ticker symbol is CGNH. Its a little low for the time being but it will pick up here very soon. The company produces heart transplants parts. That means there going to be producing thousands of parts and big bucks for stock holders. I have about 15,000 shares in the company, But my account is with Share builder. Do your research if need be but im telling you it will be a money making stock.
        </p> Royce Low Price Stock Fund symbol RYLPX. <br>
