<h1>Small businesses to invest in?</h1>
<div class="answer">Hi,

 im wanting to find some real newcomer or small businesses that I can invest in, maybe 10 different businesses I can invest 300$ in each worldwide, that can jsut be left there that an hopefully get me a good return in 20 years time.

any ideas?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> You are better off investing your 300 USD in listed companies since small businesses are very risky. According to the book &quot;Illusions of Entrepreneurship: The Costly Myths that Entrepreneurs, Investors, and Policy Makers Live By&quot;, 38% of start up companies fail after 4 years. The percentage will be even lower after 20 years. With these statistics, there&#039;s a chance you&#039;ll loss all your money with start up companies. <br>
 <br>
I suggest you find 10 listed growth stocks and invest 300 USD each and come back after 20 years. <br>
 <br>
Here&#039;s a computation of your expected return on this investment: <br>
 <br>
300 x 10 = 3,000 USD (total investment for 10 companies) <br>
 <br>
Assuming you get a 10% return per year and you hold it for 20 years. <br>
 <br>
3,000 x (1.10)^20 = 20,182.50 USD <br>
