<h1>$2000 to invest?</h1>
<div class="answer">My grandmother just recently gave me $2000 to invest.  Since it&amp;#39;s my grandmother&amp;#39;s hard earned money, I don&amp;#39;t really want to invest it in stocks and mutual funds where I could potentially lose it.  I&amp;#39;m a fairly aggressive investor myself, but since it isn&amp;#39;t my money, I want to be a little more conservative with the investment. What investments can I make (other than putting it in an high interest savings account) that can help me grow her money?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Invest it in a way that is appropriate for your financial position.  I bet your grandmother would want you do do what&#039;s best for you with it. <br>
 <br>
I&#039;d suggest investing it in an S&amp;P index fund.  Good return and low expenses. <br>
 <br>
By the way, it&#039;s your money now.  Invest it in a way she&#039;d be proud of, not the way she&#039;d invest it for herself.  She has completely different investment needs.
        </p> Bonds or CD.  <br>
 <br>
Since you grandmother is probably in her 60s, she can&#039;t afford to lose money in the stock market, although over time it outperforms Bonds and CDs. She needs that money for retirement.
        </p> A high yielding Certificate of Deposit. <br>
