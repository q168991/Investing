<h1>Ways to Start Investing Money?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am going to High School and earning about $400 a week in a casual job. Could someone please suggest some ways I could invest this money?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Start with whatever lump sum you have, at least $500-1000. <br>
 <br>
Find a good online broker or open an account at a local brokerage firm with a broker you feel comfortable with. <br>
 <br>
Buy either Investor&#039;s Business Daily or the Wall Street Journal at least twice a week and follow the news in the business and investing community. <br>
 <br>
Put your first $1500 to work into a stock of your own choosing that you think has the potential to make substantial profits and earnings in the future. At least $300 a month or so is a good start to put into a brokerage account after your inital deposit. After you have a position in one company and sufficient capital to continue investing then look to buy a second stock. When you have over $5000 in stock assets, consider diversification and buying a third stock; watch all your stocks like a hawk, without being overly quick or overly slow to take profits or cut losses. In time, alot of it should come naturally if you continue to educate yourself, read and stay on top of the financial news.

</script><p> Putting money into a 401K doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;re doing it correctly. My vote is to not do a thing until you learn the basics. The most logical place to start is Stock Mutual Funds. Get some basic books on Mutual Funds (at least 2-3). This is not going to be painful. In addition also read 2-3 books on stock investing. Then... you&#039;ll be ready to choose a broker or no load, low fee Mutual Fund company. I&#039;m not a big fan of eTrade.... but you could do worse. Check out TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab &amp; Fidelity.
        </p> Damn, I wish I was making $400 a week when I was in high school. That&#039;s around $20k a year, plenty to get started with the stock market. Start reading about the stock market and how to trade on it now, and by the time you&#039;ve saved up $5,000 you will have the knowledge to start. <br>
 <br>
***investopedia*** has some good articles for beginners and also a stock market simulator that lets you set up a pretend stock portfolio with fake money if you want to try it out before you start investing for real.
        </p> Try to invest in someones business. You may receive up to 20% guaranteed interest a year. You will not get such high guaranteed returns on stocks, mutual funds, bonds or CD&#039;s. <br>
If you invest $10,000 at 20% annual interest rate, you will get back $24,883.20 in 5 years. I run my own business and my net profit is over 5% a month. <br>
 <br>
Email me at investment4us@hotmail*** and I&#039;ll give you a valuable advice if you are serious about investing. Please don&#039;t forget to mention your nickname and question at Y.A. <br>
Best of luck!
        </p> Mutal funds for either stocks, international stocks, bonds, money market, etc. <br>

If you want to buy stocks, look at DRIPS.  Dividend Reinvestment Plans that allow you to invest small amounts whenever or each month.  Many companies have DRIPs for their stock.  The minimum investment can start as low as $10 or up to $100.
        </p> Penny stocks are loosely categorized companies with share prices of below $5 and with market caps of under $200 million. They are sometimes referred to as &quot;the slot machines of the equity market&quot; because of the money involved. There may be a good place for penny stocks in the portfolio of an experienced, advanced investor, however, if you follow this guide you will learn the most efficient strategies https://tr.im/c8109
