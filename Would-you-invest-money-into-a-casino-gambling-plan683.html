<h1>Would you invest money into a casino gambling plan?</h1>
<div class="answer">Myself and a friend of mine have come up with a plan to play a certain table game at the casinos that, after approximately six months of testing, seems to be capable of making money in the long run. In our six month test run, using authentic equipment and dealing techniques that the actual casinos use, we have profited approximately $60,000 each after an initial investment of $5,000.

My question is, would anyone out there actually consider investing $5,000 or $10,000 in this plan with a minimum of a 200% return over a six month period? If we did actually find an investor, they would be briefed on the plan itself and how it works, and be shown our documentation for our test runs.

I was just curious if anyone out there would actually invest in such a plan, or if everyone would automatically say no because it involves gambling.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> You might, but don&#039;t forget, casinos can ban you from playing if you win too much.  They have the right to refuse you for any reason, and winning is one of them. <br>
 <br>
And once you&#039;re banned at one, your face will be in the database of every major casino on earth.  They all talk and share info, and they&#039;re quite scary if you&#039;re on their bad side. <br>
 <br>
So, unfortunately, this may be fun but short-lived. <br>
 <br>
If, however, you can use this technique in games against other gamblers, not the house, you could probably do it forever.   <br>
 <br>
The casinos know the odds of winning on any game, down to the millionth percentile.  Anyone who is beating those odds too consistently is presumed to be cheating, or counting cards, or whatever.  Doesn&#039;t matter.  They have every legal right to prevent people from winning too often. <br>
 <br>
Go out and buy &quot;Busting Vegas&quot; by Ben Mezrich.  It&#039;s a book about a bunch of MIT math whizzes that nailed the casinos in blackjack for a short time.  Nothing they did was actually illegal, but they had a very scary ending to their fun.  Easy quick read, and pretty darn interesting.  It might open your eyes a bit about the possible consequences of your business plan. <br>
 <br>
Good luck.
        </p> Hi Semyon- I agree with what Len has said. I would also add that like anything in life, if you practice and study something rather than randomly participating in it you will do well. As an example, if you were to practice playing tennis five days a week you would become a pretty good player vs. stopping at the court once a year. Your success in stock investing is not something you should feel you have to prove to anyone. Unfortunately, that’s a whole other layer of emotional baggage that won’t help you in your investing. As you begin or continue to invest you can decide for yourself and yourself only, if it’s something that you enjoy. There may be some truth to the idea that stock investing is risky, however, those of us who are successful put certain probabilities into our favor that helps to level off the risk. Also, keep in mind that you have the option to set sell points for every stock you purchase so you protect your capital. Best of luck!
        </p> I can assist you with your venture if you are still needing more funds, based upon the situation.
