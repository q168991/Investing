</script><p> If you have money you could set aside for your retirement, by all means you open a Roth IRA account at one of the brokerage firms in order to trade in stocks, bonds and/or mutual funds. There is a limit on how much you can contribute to Roth IRA; $5,000/yr if you are younger than 50 years old and $6,000 if you are older than 50. <br>
 <br>
As for investment advise on buying stocks, bonds and/or mutual funds, it&#039;s better to ask one of the brokers at your brokerage firm rather than asking Yahoo Answerers.
        </p> You can probably buy a fund with low expenses and cover all investment categories. I like Fidelity Four-in-One fund which has a combination of domestic large and small cap, international and bond all in one fund, plus it has a low fee
        </p> If you want both equity and bond investments, look at balanced funds.  You get both in a single fund.
        </p> Never wait to invest, time is your biggest asset. Investigate the mysteries of compound interest.
