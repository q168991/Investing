<h1>Books on investing for beginners?</h1>
<div class="answer">Hey everyone :-)

I would like to know if anyone knows of any good books that will help someone with the process of investing. Mind you, the book(s) is (are) for someone who knows absolutely nothing about investing and wants to learn from scratch. So no fancy lingo or jargon and all that. Something nice and simple. And yes...I&amp;#39;m checking Amazon too :)<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

&quot;The Only Investment Guide You&#039;ll Ever Need&quot; by Andrew Tobias <br>
 <br>
&quot;A Random Walk Guide to Investing&quot; by Burton Malkiel <br>
 <br>
&quot;Investing for Dummies&quot; by Eric Tyson <br>
 <br>
The first two are as much personal finance guides as investment guides and have definite recommendations.  The third book focuses more content on investment only and is much more neutral in tone.  After you read the Amazon reviews, flip through the books either online or in a bookstore.  Feel free to drop me a line and ask me any questions you might have about the books before buying them.

        </p> I haven&#039;t read &quot;Investing for Dummies&quot;, and it may be quite good, but even for a beginner, I&#039;d rather suggest a GOOD book on investing, rather than an EASY book on investing.  There&#039;s nothing worse than below average investing advice.   <br>

Robert Kiyosaki is brilliant on many subjects, especially on how to manage your life for increasing income.  However, if you&#039;re interested in the stock market, I don&#039;t think of him as an expert in this area at all.  If your friend is interested in real estate, however, Kiyosaki&#039;s books would be excellent.  But not for stock investing. <br>
 <br>
For stock market investing, the best introductory book is probably Peter Lynch&#039;s &quot;One Up on Wall Street&quot;.
        </p> This&#039;ll do the trick.   <br>
 <br>
&quot;The Wall Street Journal Complete Money and Investing Guidebook.&quot;  -- Highly recommended.   <br>

Book Description from back cover of book: <br>
 <br>
&quot;Unravel the Mysteries of the Financial Markets—the Language, the Players, and the Strategies for Success <br>
 <br>
Understanding money and investing has never been more important than it is today, as many of us are called upon to manage our own retirement planning, college savings funds, and health-care costs. Up-to-date and expertly written, The Wall Street Journal Complete Money and Investing Guidebook provides investors with a simple—but not simplistic—grounding in the world of finance. It breaks down the basics of how money and investing work, explaining: <br>
 <br>
• What must-have information you need to invest in stocks, bonds, and mutual funds  <br>
 <br>
• How to see through the inscrutable theories and arcane jargon of financial insiders and advisers  <br>
 <br>
• What market players, investing strategies, and money and investing history you should know <br>
 <br>
• Why individual investors should pay attention to the economy  <br>
 <br>
Written in a clear, engaging style by Dave Kansas, one of America’s top business journalists and editor of The Wall Street Journal Money &amp; Investing section, this straightforward book is full of helpful charts, graphs, and illustrations and is an essential source for novice and experienced investors alike.  <br>
 <br>
Get your financial life in order with help from The Wall Street Journal.&quot;
        </p> Penny stocks are loosely categorized companies with share prices of below $5 and with market caps of under $200 million. They are sometimes referred to as &quot;the slot machines of the equity market&quot; because of the money involved. There may be a good place for penny stocks in the portfolio of an experienced, advanced investor, however, if you follow this guide you will learn the most efficient strategies https://tr.im/fb19f

        </p> Reading the reserve instead of seeing the movie is the ultimate way to see what the writer meant. Reading uses your creativity, hones your reading skills, and can transform your vocabulary
        </p> Barnes and Nobles or any good book store chain should have &quot;Investing For Dummies&quot; - I myself purchased this and it really is very informative
        </p> The Rich Dad books are great.  Rich Dad, Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki.  You may want to check your local library first to see what they have.
