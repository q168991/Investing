</script><p> Before you spend $0.01 on any investment, you must know what you’re doing, why you’re doing it and how to do it.  Before you invest in any security, the first investment you should make is in yourself, and the best investment you can make is by educating yourself.  <br>
 <br>
Begin your education by learning why you should invest and the importance of being able to make your own decisions or how the pro’s make theirs. Start your education by reading “Investing or Dummies” by Eric Tyson. <br>
To continue your education select some of the following  <br>

 <br>
Websites that can provide instructions and help with procedures and terminology are Investopedia - http://***investopedia***/ http://***investorshub***/  and 1 Source for Stocks - http://***1source4stocks***/info/stock... or Smart Money  <br>
http://***smartmoney***/ <br>
Visit some of the more professional websites like  Zacks Research - http://***zacks***/ Schaeffer’s http://***schaeffersresearch***/ Investors Business Daily - http://***investors***/default.htm?fromad=1   <br>
Some of these web sites will have advertisers who are worth looking into also. And remember, if they offer free information, get it.   <br>
 <br>
Attend all the free seminars you can, just be careful and don’t get pressured into anything you really don’t want or need. Most schools offer courses in finance and economics, but very few will have courses on the mechanics of the investment markets, if they do try taking the course. You may want to consider on-line courses, the New York Institute of Finance use to have such courses. Try to get some fee information from The stocks exchanges they all have (had) free booklets, SIAC and some of the regulators (FINRA SEC MSRB CBOE) may provide some free literature. <br>
 <br>
And when you think you want to invest/trade, try some paper trading to test your skills without spending you money http://simulatorinvestopedia***/   http://***moneyworks4me***/  <br>
and/or http://***tradingsimulation***/  <br>
 <br>
You at least have made the right decision to start investing, this is the first big step and it won’t be your last. Keep taking those steps forward and along the way never take the advice from people that are not in the market or try to tell you not to invest. <br>
 <br>
Good luck on journey, study hard and you’ll invest well.

 <br>
There are exceptions of course. Sometimes you will find some long-term trades that pay off big! Other times you will get into what are known as swing trades and those can really pay off as well. Most of the time though, profitable penny stock trading is all about the short game.  <br>
 <br>
In most cases you will buy and sell the same stock within a week. I’m not talking about day-trading which you may have heard about before. That’s a completely different game with a different set of rules. (It’s also a bit more risky.)
        </p> Binary options let users trade in currency pairs and stocks for various predetermined time-periods, minimal of which is 30 seconds. Executing trades is straightforward. The system uses user-friendly interfaces, which even an 8 years old kid, can operate without having to read any instructions. But winning trades is Not easy.  <br>
Binary trading is advertised as the only genuine system that lets users earn preposterous amounts of money in ridiculously short period of time. Advertisers try to implicate as if you can make $350 every 60 seconds; if it was true then binary trading would truly be an astonishing business.  <br>
However, does it make any sense? Can every trader make tons of money in binary trading? Who is actually paying all the money or the profit to traders?  <br>
The first challenge is finding a trustworthy binary broker; secondly, you need to find a binary trading strategy, which you can use to make profits consistently. Without an effective trading strategy, there is no way you can make money in this business. <br>

I&#039;ve been trading the market for just a few months. My cousin actually told me about this website ( http://pennystocks.toptips.org ) and I signed up immediately after. This is my honest review about their method. I&#039;m not someone who has a lot of time to be researching for ideas because I work many hours. they made it incredibly easy for me to make money in the market. Their reports are easy to read and follow. I&#039;ve tracked most of the stock ideas that I&#039;ve received in my e-mail from them and MANY have seen some nice gains after their announcements. I&#039;ve made a nice profit (55% return on my investment on one, and 112% on the other!) on a couple of suggestions he&#039;s given and plan to start trading his ideas a lot more.  <br>

        </p> Without knowing your financial situation its hard to know.

Trading and investing are more stressful than many normal jobs - highest rates of suicide and alcoholism of course.

         No easy answers for this.If you know business,start one.The rich got out of the market a month ago.If you want to be rich,you have to be around the rich and be sharp to pick up on things they do.
        </p> Depends on the risk level that you are prepared to take. Low risk generally means low gain potential. I would suggest professionally managed funds, using your annual ISA allowance. Check out the Daily Mail financial web site for all kinds of information. <br>

        </p> This is a question that could be best answered by communicating one on one.  If you are serious about investment you may contact me.  I feel that this question could best be answered by talking to a person and get to know them so I can get a feel of how to assist and answer the question properly.
