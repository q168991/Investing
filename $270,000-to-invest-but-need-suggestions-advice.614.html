</script><p> Financial Advisors works on commission so the Bigger the investment, the bigget their cut is going to be. And of course what they are going to tell you is no different that what I am going to tell you. <br>
 <br>
You are looking for a Long Term investment with Moderate risks. Basiaclly Financial Advisors always suggest suitability over profitability. And always invest in something that you know. Since you did mention you are an avid Golfer, what about investing it in certain Golf Companies that you know will do pretty good. Other than that they will just tell you to stick your money in Mutual Funds, which comprises of stocks and bonds. <br>
 <br>
Hope this helps

        </p> Penny stocks don’t cost much money and promise big profits. But trading penny stocks is also a good way to lose money. <br>
 <br>
Sure, it’s possible to profit when you understand the game. Learn here https://tr.im/dEq7d <br>
 <br>
For investors who can’t afford shares of Google or Apple, the potential gains from trades like this are too good to pass up. So penny-stock trading thrives. With a relatively small investment you can make a nice return if the trade works out.
        </p> 1.  Long term is NOT 5-7 years.  Long term is when you have decades until retirement.   <br>
2.  Max out your Roth IRA every year.  Put your most aggressive investments here. <br>
3.  Diversify, especiall the huge pile of money outside your Roth IRA.   <br>
4.  Due to the mortage thing, they&#039;re having a 50% off sale on bank stocks.  This might be one piece of your diversified portfolio.
        </p> I have reviewed this myself. The Schwab 1000 fund is a good one. Low fees and 12% return. <br>
If your new to all of this and need professional help I like AG Edwards as a <br>
brokerage. Over 100 year company with exceptional employees.  <br>
Yes- You pay fees but you avoid naive mistakes too. <br>
Your $40,000 can be set up as a &quot;cash management account&quot;, You&#039;ll get a debit Visa and checks that will give immediate access to those funds.
        </p> LeeLV, <br>
Try to invest in someones business if you don&#039;t want to start your own business. You may receive up to 20% guaranteed interest a year. <br>
I run my own business and my net profit is over 5% a month. <br>
 <br>
Some of the European banks offer 7% to 14% APR (3-5 years deposits). <br>

Best of luck!
        </p> FRPT.OB - Force Protection, Inc. Manufactures mine sweep armored tanks. Corporate office is right here in the USA and only recently opened up to global sales. Considering the political unrest in the Middle East as well as the homefront, you can&#039;t go wrong with this company. I bought into it when it was $3/share. It&#039;s now $22+. Best of all, it&#039;s not too late. EBAY. Is there any doubt?
        </p> Invest in ETF: ETFs are cheaper than mutual funds. ETFs have very low annual expenses, nearly 20 basis points or 0.2% less. As against this, actively managed mutual funds show average expenses exceeding 135 basis points (1.35%). This does not include the extra 2% - 5% as loads, 12(b)-1 marketing fees, transactions costs, and soft dollar expenses mutual funds, passed on to you but never informed, except in very fine print that nobody cares to read. <br>

         If you want to invest in speculative market is, do not do until you gain proper proficiency wihich is very very vital.  Invest part in short term and major in long term and study every thing patiently before investing.
        </p> hey why not invest in telecommunications shares their returns to turn around at 8-10% <br>
- or you could use that cash to run a board and breakfast holiday home while u are schooling this way u could meet new people, and semi employ someone as well <br>
- just make sure that however you invest it matchs your lifestyle
        </p> Make overseas investment. <br>
You will get a 13% rate of interest in Belarusian banks. NO RISK AT ALL because all deposits are state ensured.  <br>
No risk and high rate of return and liquidity. <br>
Or lend your money privately to Belarusian entrepreneurs who will pay you over 50% interest per year. Very low risk and high rate of return. <br>
I personally prefer to get high return with medium risk. <br>
For more details please email me at  bestinvest@land.ru (do not forget to mention in email your nickname at Yahoo Answers)
        </p> Lucky you to have such sum but looking for where to invest it. A whole lot of long term investment tips are explained on ***goldlinkup*** and I suggest you devote time to study them before making a decision. <br>

        </p> Get  a Schwab account and buy some big- really broad based mutual finds, like vanguard (great idea), buy another big dumb broad based fund with a slant to global. <br>
 <br>
The Schwab rep will happily guide you. <br>
 <br>
Then watch them grow. <br>
 <br>
Simple as that!
        </p> I was introduced to the investment of the iraqi dinar.  This speculates that you buy with $1,000 at least 1,000,000 dinars.  After iraq has a stable economy and goverment it should reval close to almost 1 USD : 1 dinar.  For more info go to http://***investorsiraq*** Good luck.
        </p> You should check out ncinvesting.org, they have several long term programs that you can make alot of money on.
        </p> Go to a financial adviser.
        </p> buy yourself a big house, <br>
live in one of the rooms, and rent the others out. <br>
when you leave college, sell it.
