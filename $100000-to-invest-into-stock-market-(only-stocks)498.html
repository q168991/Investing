<h1>$100000 to invest into stock market (only stocks)?</h1>
<div class="answer">I have $100000 to invest with to make the most gain in 10 weeks. What recommended stocks/companies should be chosen to make the most gain? It&amp;#39;s not real money; it&amp;#39;s just a game at my school in Ohio.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> FACT: - In fact this is really happening: <br>
Stocks go down six times faster than they go up. <br>
 <br>
This IS going to require some additional and extra work on your part: <br>
1] Ask your teacher if you can learn about AND use &quot;shorting&quot; or &quot;going short&quot; on stocks. <br>
 <br>
2] Ask your teacher if you can learn about AND use &quot;Options - both Puts and Calls&quot; <br>
 <br>
IF your teacher says OK, then you should do a lot better than you would buying stocks. <br>
 <br>
I hope your teacher says its OK - for all of what I suggested. <br>
 <br>
IF you get permission, you should be able to get the help you need. <br>
 <br>
Thanks for asking your Q! I enjoyed answering it!  <br>

Yes, that is my real last name!

</script><p> You will need to setup an account w/a broker to trade stocks, bonds, or mutual funds. There are several online brokerages, the largest of which are: TDAmeritrade, eTrade, Scottrade, ING direct (Sharebuilder), Charles Schwab, &amp; Fidelity. All of them charge fees to buy &amp; to sell stocks. Some of the fees are a flat rate, regardless of the # of shares you buy/sell, others will prorate their fees based on # of shares/total amount. Plan on paying $7-$10 per transaction. You should try to keep your fees below 5% (e.g. plan on buying at least $400 worth of stock if your fees are $10/trans). Knowing what to purchase is the really tough part. You might want to check out &quot;The Motley Fool&quot; or &quot;SmartMoney&quot; for ideas.
        </p> If everyone with that amount of money could get information from the internet to gain the most in 10 weeks, what would all the stockbroker do?
        </p> Try a pharmaceutical company like Pfizer or Abbott or Amgen. That&#039;s about the only sector with positive returns so far this year.
        </p> Sell CFD&#039;s on a declining bank, eg Citigroup or JP Morgan.   You could also buy commodities such as gold as the price is rising.
        </p> Look at which stocks have been beat up the most lately and buy those.  Financials have been ravaged.
        </p> This is a tricky time to try for short-term gains.  I wouldn&#039;t.
