</script><p> Congrats on getting into a position where you are able to begin investing.  Whatever avenue you choose to invest in make sure you do your due diligence so you do not make any blind decisions.  An investment vehicle that I would recommend that you check out would be the Foreign Currency Exchange (FOREX).  Two great sites that will help you do your due diligence are http://***babypips*** and http://***wiseforexinvestor***  I have personal experience with the FOREX market and I am so glad that took the time to check it out.  If you have any questions please let me know.  Call or Email me and I will be happy to discuss it further with you.  <br>

</script><p> The stock market can be risky at the best of times, even for experienced investors.  However, everyone has to start somewhere, and if you do not start now then when will you acquire the necessary experience? <br>
 <br>
Do read some books on the subject.  Visit your local book store and find a book that you like and feel comfortable with.  <br>
 <br>
Some of the titles I have on my bookshelf include: <br>
One Up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch <br>
How to make money in Stocks by William J. O’Neil (Founder of Investor’s Business Daily) <br>
The Millionaire Next Door by Thomas J Stanley and William D Danco <br>
 <br>
Check out web sites like fool*** and yahoo finance. <br>
 <br>
Investigate trading strategies with a proven track record over 3, 5, 10, and 15 years. <br>
 <br>
Pick something that you understand, find easy to use, will help you realise your goals, and where you can take responsibility for your investments and be in full control of your capital. <br>
 <br>
Systems like the Stocks Monthly system are definitely worth investigating once you are up to speed with the nuts and bolts of investing.
        </p> I think alot of people over look the most important starting point for investing...good ole fashioned cash!  Money market funds or CD&#039;s are a good start.  Cash hould be built up to equal about 4-6 months of your total income before you even think about putting money into any securities markets according to alot of financial journalists.   <br>
 <br>
From there foreward if you are honestly unclear of what to , go see a financial analyst.  Dont put your hard earned money at risk in  somthing you dont know a whole lot about.

        </p> Contact a Financial Advisor
        </p> Start small with an INGDirect CD.  They have great rates with almost no risk.  If you want stocks look for something that will never go out of style...amusement parks.  I bought stock in a large US amusement park company for my son when he was born.  It is really performing... and now when he goes to the park he thinks he owns it! <br>
 <br>
Cant go wrong with electric companies, fuel, or fast food chains.  Have fun.
        </p> An excellent website for the beginner investor is ***financial-realities101***. They offer great information that will get you on the right track.
        </p> your investment has to do with something you are familiar with. consult people whom you know and gather information before laying down your capital.
        </p> Try Vanguard.
