<h1>Which of these mutual funds should I invest in Short term (1 year)?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am putting a portion of my portfolio on higher risk mutual funds. The goal is to buy c shares and purchase them for 6 months to 2 years depending on market conditions. We are currently narrowed down to the following funds.. I would probably want 2-4 final choices. I would like some opinions / information on the chosen sectors etc:

</script><p> I think you need a new broker.  Either that, or do it yourself with no-load funds (it&#039;s really not that hard). <br>
 <br>
What he&#039;s recommending is bad advice at BEST, and possibly illegal (the industry term is &quot;churning&quot;). <br>
 <br>
There is no way he should be recommending ANY mutual funds for such a short time horizon.  Historically, stocks have lost money about 1 out of every 3 years.  That means your odds of losing money are greater than 33% (because of the high fees you&#039;ll pay on these funds). <br>
 <br>
Short term you should be looking at CD&#039;s and money market accounts.  They&#039;re only paying 5-6% right now, but you&#039;re guaranteed not to lose money.  The reason your broker doesn&#039;t recommend them is that he gets no commission if you do this. <br>
 <br>
EDIT - Trying to pick &quot;hot&quot; sectors is a fool&#039;s game.  Everyone has an opinion, but trust me - NOBODY knows what sectors will outperform the market in the next year (let alone 2-3 years).  The worst thing that can happen is that you&#039;ll guess correctly - then you&#039;ll think you&#039;re good at it, and risk more next time.  The best strategy is to pick diversified mutual funds and, if you have enough for several funds, pick a sector fund that you think will do well over the next 20-30 years (or however long until you retire) - but limit it to 10-15% of your overall portfolio. <br>
 <br>
If you hold the fund(s) for over a year, I don&#039;t think it would be churning, but please be aware that all of these funds have extremely high expense ratios.  The lowest is Eaton Vance Utilities at 1.81%.  That is SIX TIMES higher than Vanguard&#039;s utilities fund, at 0.28%. <br>
 <br>
That said, if you still want to go ahead with this questionable strategy, I would stick with the funds that have the &quot;lowest&quot; expenses - Dryden Global Real Estate, Jennison Natural Resources, and Eaton Vance Utilities.

</script><p> Ask yourself, <br>
 <br>
1. What is your short-term goal?  What return rate are you looking for?  The market is in great shape, now but you need to be cautious for such a short period.  <br>
2.  What is your risk tolerance?  You seem to have average to above average risk.  <br>
3.  What asset class are you looking for? large cap, small cap, etc <br>
3.  Do you have enough for the minimal initial investment?  The developed markets has a $50k minimum  <br>
 <br>
Van Eck Global Hard Assets C ( NASDAQ:GHACX ) looks to be the only Global balanced portfolio in your list.   The rest are either industry/sector specific, which is okay for a portion of your portfolio (10-25%), depending on age/risk level, but you must know that trends change.  Right now, emerging market, utilities, china, latin america are in favor, whille real estate is lagging in US markets, but is doing okay globally overall.  The high-end real estate, which buoys most of the portfolios is still strong even in US, so real estate may be a portion.   <br>
 <br>
How about pick 2 from your list.  are you planning on withdrawing all the money after a year?
        </p> None of these choices are good, for two basic reasons: <br>
 <br>
1)  C-class shares have loads.  Also, these funds have outrageous expense ratios.  Loads are for suckers because they make the brokerages richer and you poorer.  Don&#039;t EVER pay a load.  Don&#039;t EVERY pay 12b-1 fees. <br>
 <br>
Go to http://***vanguard*** and take a look at their fees. <br>
 <br>
2)  Your time horizon is too short to invest in stocks.  You need a short-term bond fund, money market account, or bank CDs for a 1-year time horizon. <br>
 <br>
Switching in and out of funds frequently is a recipe for disaster.  Not only are you buying assets at their peak prices, but you are also paying transaction costs. <br>
 <br>
You need to completely rethink your investing paradigm.  This is the wrong way to go about investing.  Do yourself a favor and please read about investing before you wind up losing your money. <br>

- Mutual Funds for Dummies, by Eric Tyson <br>
- http://***invest-for-retirement*** has a free downloadable book.  It will teach you how to be an investor, not a corporate tool.
        </p> I would check out these funds not just on a short term basis, but also long term on how they perform and whether it is the same manager who accomplishes the better performance. Also, watch out for risk and fees to make sure you are not overpaying the performance on volatility and cost etc. One of the new site you can use is called fundmojo, I looked at some of your choices there, PNRCX looks pretty decent at a B rating, I think the reason is that manager is only been there for 2 years. MCLTX has a C+ rating since it has not been consistently over-perform. Check out yourself and hopefully it adds some value to your decision.
        </p> You kind of give me a real difficult choice.  I understand what you are aiming at, but I am not particularly thrilled with your choices.  They all have very steep expense ratios, being C funds.  Among those selected, I would have to pick the one investing in China DPCCX but the expense ratio is ungodly. and one of the two natural resourse selections, the one with the most oil securities GHACX.    <br>
 <br>
But before jumping in on either of those two, consider a less expensive alternative.  For China investment maybe CAF currently selling at an 11% discount to net assets and an expense ratio somewhat less than DPCCX.  A few days ago you could have picked it up at 16% discount but it went gang busters a few days ago.  Another GCF,  but a different type of Chinese portfolio.  You buy both just like stock.   <br>

 <br>
For a decent play in oils,  there are a couple of index funds with real low expense ratios.  <br>
 <br>
RYE is one.   <br>

        </p> If the return must be positive, you had better go with a money market fund. The general rule for stock funds is five years. For bond funds perhaps three years is sufficient.
        </p> Don&#039;t. <br>
 <br>
A mutual fund is not a good short-term investment vehicle. You might make out OK in any of them, but a mutual fund should be considered a long-term investment - at least five year horizon.
        </p> Hi, <br>
Rather then putting this money in Mfs try investing it in Nationalised Bank FDs for 1 year. This this the most safest way.
