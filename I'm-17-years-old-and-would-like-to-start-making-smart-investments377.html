</script><p> I am 18, so that means I&#039;m smarter than you (I&#039;m just kidding, but seriously I was in your place a month ago).  The best place to put your money is an IRA, preferably a Roth IRA for you since you do not pay high income taxes.  With this, you can go into stocks or mutual funds, which are generally the best-yielding investments.  Money invested now will yield an inflation-adjusted 14 times when you retire at 59.5 (Roth IRA standard), and that is only at 10%, the market average.  You can open a normal brokerage account, but they will tax you heavily and will be less eligible for student aid for college.  I suggest you go to investopedi*** and do some research.  Do note that whether or not you can buy stocks depend on the age of majority for stocks in your state, which varies widely.  I emailed support at TradeKing*** to ask the age of majority in MD, and they got back to me quickly.  If you have any further questions feel free to email me.  It sounds like I&#039;m a few months ahead of you (I started avid investment research 3 months ago about). <br>
 <br>
Make sure you have enough for college if you plan on going (if you&#039;re smart enough to invest I&#039;m sure you got the brains).  I am saving $3500 for my first year and it should be at the least 2500.  I only have 3400 in my bank account, however, so I am disappointed that I have to delay my investing.  Despite that, I make about 220 a week so it&#039;s not a big deal.  The important thing is to budget.  Good luck. <br>
 <br>
P.S. if you are into investing as much as I am I would not mind sharing my ideas with you.  I have put about 200+ hours into studying, and there are plenty of profitable opportunities.  Email me if you are interested.

</script><p> honestly, if you really want to be financially set, it is going to take a long time and a lot of hard work. The $1000 is a good start. I am going to make a two assumptions: 1) You have no debt. 2) You are planning to go to college. If these are both correct, then here is some advice for you: 1) Do NOT get a credit card. You don&#039;t need one and they only lead to trouble. Forget what most people tell you about building a good credit score, most people are BROKE. 2) Budget your money and don&#039;t spend what you don&#039;t have. 3) There are a LOT of scholarships and grants out there. Look around and apply for as many as you can. I&#039;m talking about applying for dozens if not hundreds. You won&#039;t get all or even most of them, but the few you do get will be worth it. 4) Stay away from student loans. They will be an anchor around your financial neck for years to come. Most students (including me when I was younger) don&#039;t use student loans to pay for college, the use them to pay for their lifestyle when they are in college. You may not want to live like you are poor in college, but guess what? You are. Live within your means now and I promise you won&#039;t regret it later. 5) Don&#039;t buy a new car and NEVER lease a car. Again, don&#039;t believe the hype. Save up and pay cash for a good used car. That all being said, the best place for the first $1000 you have is in an emergency fund. Emergency funds are to be used for true emergencies. Losing your job and needing to buy food and pay rent until you get another one is an emergency. A pair of shoes or a PS3 on sale at the mall is not. The radiator on your car blowing is an emergency. Christmas presents are not.
        </p> ok, assuming you live at home and have no expenses, how would you like to be a millionaire when you retire using just the money you make in the next year?  No, this isn&#039;t some scam, bear with me. <br>
 <br>
at 200 a week, you will make slightly over 10K in the next year. If you invest all of that money in a good stock market fund (Vanguard Total Stock Market index) and get the historical average of 10%, you will have a little over a million in the bank when you hit 65, even if you NEVER invest another cent the rest of your life.  Keep investing as you go, and several million is very doable.  I know 65 seems like long way off right now, and you probably would rather spend some of it on fun stuff with friends, but ask anyone over 50 if they would do this if they could go back to when they were 17
        </p> There are so many facets in your situation that would decide whether you would put your money in a risky stock that MAY give you a good return, a safe money market, ETF fund or any other kind of fund that would make it safe. The best way, meanng safest is to invest your money in a managed fund that has different stocks in that paricular fund. Then when one or two goes down, the other winners will override the losers. What you need right now is education. Go to your library and read as many books on stock markets as you can for one year while you save. While doing this, go online such as MSN and go to the Finance site and use their practice portfolio to see how you do with virtual, not real money. You can choose any other site that has a practice portfolio. Then later you can make your decision to buy stocks of your choosing and I bet you will have a better understanding of the stock market. A book to start out with that is easy to understand is RULE#1, by Phil Town. You don&#039;t have to use his method exactly, but it gives you a good understanding of how the market works. Keep your money safe and learn so you can earn.
        </p> Good for you at 17.  Your parents should be proud. <br>
 <br>
Can I start by saying that you should <br>
 <br>
1. Be very careful with your hard earned money <br>
 <br>
2. Learn as much as you can about investing before you take any advice.  <br>
 <br>
3. Anyone selling you something has their best interest&#039;s not yours. <br>
 <br>
Commission based financial planners are useful as if you don&#039;t get a certain performance they get nothing. <br>

Otherwise, have fun and kudos  to you on your hard work.
        </p> I&#039;d recommend investing in the following in that order: <br>
 <br>
1) Pay off credit card debt!!! No matter how attractive other investments maybe, you can&#039;t get more for your buck than paying off that 15-20% credit card debt. <br>
 <br>
2) Save up for education! Since you&#039;re only 17, you going to college?  This will be the best investment you&#039;ll make.
