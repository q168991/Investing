<h1>Am I to young to start investing in stocks?</h1>
<div class="answer">I&amp;#39;m 16 years old and I&amp;#39;m interested in investing in the stock market. I&amp;#39;ve been reading up quite a bit lately, trying to educate myself on the workings of the stock market, and I think its something I would like to try.

Someone recently gave me $400, and I figured instead of spending it like most teenagers would do, I would invest in some stocks. I know $400 isn&amp;#39;t very much money at all, but it&amp;#39;s a start. I&amp;#39;m not disillusioned...I don&amp;#39;t expect to become rich overnight, but I figure I&amp;#39;d do something constructive with my money.  Now here&amp;#39;s my questions:

1. Am I to young and/or stupid to begin investing
2. Is now a bad time to start investing (considering the economy)



Any tips or suggestions would also be greatly appreciated...<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> No, your not too young it&#039;s  good to think about your money. The economy actually provides a great time for your stocks because it can only go up. I mean it might take 5 to 10 years but it will go up and you can make some money. Good Luck. <br>

</script><p> No, you&#039;re not too young to start investing. However, I would suggest letting a reputable broker handle it. As for your second question, the economy is bad at the moment but for a patient and smart investor money can be made in it if you invest smartly. This is why I suggest letting a broker handle the matter.  <br>
 <br>
Before you choose a broker, be sure to do a lot of research into all your options. Learn as much as you can about investing on your own to protect yourself and also pave the way to you handling your own trading activities. <br>
 <br>
*Edit*  <br>
I see a lot have said no because the economy may falter even more. While this is true and is one of the risks of investing, you CAN NOT go into debt. If you were to invest in a failed stock, you simply lose your money. Should you decide to invest do it wisely.  <br>
 <br>
If you decide that the market isn&#039;t right for you, open a high yeild savings account instead. Your money will grow with little risk and provide a safety net down the road.
        </p> You are not too young, and definitly not stupid, as your money compounds at even 10% a year, you will see your money grow exponentially. Most people wait till they are in their 30s and don&#039;t have a significant retirement fund until their 70s.  <br>
but I think most stock brokers require you to be 18 years old, so you might need someone else to actually sign up for an account, or to complete your transactions.  <br>
 <br>
This is a great time to get into stocks while the economy is hit. You will clean up and become a master of stock broking. You might become the next Warren Buffet.  <br>
 <br>
Do not wait. You want to buy when the economy is bad. Always trade against the flow. When everyone is selling in a panic, you can buy stocks dirt cheap. When everyone is rushing to buy the next big trend, its time to sell the stocks for big money. <br>
 <br>
edit: Unless you got a loan to invest in the stockmarket (which would be a stupid idea) you wont be in debt from a bad stock trade.
        </p> First of all you are never too young (im 18) <br>
Second you learn through practice as well so if you have the idea you will be alright. <br>
400 is a small amount relatively speaking and if you are not careful commissions will KIll you.  As long as you are going for long term rather than daytrading you will be fine. <br>
Unfortunately your age is a small problem and you will have to have your parents sign off (i know it sucks but hey thats life til your 18)  <br>
company&#039;s like scottrade will allow you to do this (this would be my number one recommendation for a brokerage firm as well) <br>
 <br>
THIS IS THE ABSOLUTE BEST TIME TO START INVESTING SINCE 1939.  Okay that may be a little bit overstated but not by much.  If you know what you are doing and are young (you are) and can take risks because of it, this economy will return sooner or later and your golden <br>
Your outta luck if your 65 right now and your retirement got cut in half but if your 16 be happy
        </p> $50 Even if you quadruple your money (which would be extremely rare), you will still only make $150 a year in profit. The discount brokerages that will allow you to open with nothing to open an account are the ones that have the most complaints. You will be hit hard with commissions. About $10 to buy a stock and $10 to sell. Never go through a bank for this. They will have fees that will drain your blood right out of your body. Discount brokerages are the only way to go. The best require minimum deposits. Note: You could also lose the entire $50 if you buy a risky stock and the company goes under.
        </p> I don&#039;t think it&#039;s a good idea to invest in stocks. You&#039;ll end up having to pay more because of the economy. Wait when things are back on track and people are starting to earn back money then invest some but don&#039;t put everything on the line.
        </p> 1. a)  Am I too young <br>
No.  You have three options: <br>
i.)  Wait until you&#039;re 18, so you can open an account on your own. <br>
ii.)  Get one of your parents to open a custodial account in your name. <br>
iii) Get one of your parents to open an ESA 529 Plan (Education Savings plan).  Your parents can contribute up to $2000 per year until you&#039;re 18 for college.  The returns are tax free: http://***irs.gov/taxtopics/tc310.html <br>
 <br>
1. b) Am I too stupid <br>
No because of what you put in your additional details.  The best market participants aim to minimize risk and maximize return.  The dumbest only think they will make returns and then show off when they do. <br>
 <br>
2. No, now is the best time.
        </p> At age 16 there are many other teens that are investing. In my high school there are teens your age that have already invested and are successful. You never know what can happen. A tip would be to go on virtual stock markets to see how well or bad you do.
        </p> simply put <br>
 <br>
1 no, as long as you have a some over 18 do the trading your fine <br>
2 it&#039;s a great time to invest with stocks at historic lows the market is severely undervalued, meaning good investment opportunity
        </p> 1) def. not stupid however you wont be able to open a brokerage account on your own till your 18, you can always have your parents open one for you but most brokerage&#039;s have a min. of $500 to start.  <br>
 <br>
2) now is actually a pretty good time to invest if you are willing to gone for the long haul,

2) now is actually a pretty good time to invest if you are willing to gone for the long haul,
         I think that if you are educated and understand what you are getting in to then it can be a great idea. However remember to think about the status of the current economy. I wouldn&#039;t do it.
        </p> i do not think it is a good idea for you to invest in a stock because you are young and if the stock market goes way DOWN!!! then you might be in debt for a long time.
        </p> 1. i don&#039;t know. <br>
2. Yes, it&#039;s a terrible time. I would wait a couple years, at least until you&#039;re eighteen. The economy will only get worse before it gets better.
        </p> Honestly I think you&#039;re a good kid. Sorry I couldn&#039;t answer your question but you seem like a very responsible person, I&#039;m not even lieing!
        </p> u only need to learn it before invest, all u need is to study 1st
        </p> I&#039;d like to do that but government won&#039;t let me :(.
