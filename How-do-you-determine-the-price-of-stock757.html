<h1>How do you determine the price of stock?</h1>
<div class="answer">I'm just curious... like yesterday when that false American Airlines article was posted on the internet about how they're going under, their stock was at 12$ a share that morning. After the article had been on the internet for a little while, stockholders began selling immediately! The price dropped to 3$/share, and then when everyone figured out it was a hoax, the price went back up to around 11$. How do they determine it's worth 11, or 3, or 12? <p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> The answer is, honestly... stupid. The price of a Stock is whatever it was last sold at. Several Economic Market factors and Psychology play into what people are willing to buy and sell it as. <br>
 <br>
So just like everything else, Stocks are worth as much as someone is willing to pay for them

</script><p> It&#039;s called supply and demand. If there are too many buyers, they bid up the price. If there are too many sellers, they have to lower their prices to find a buyer. In the stock market there are so many buyers and sellers at any given moment that prices change constantly. In other words, if the price goes up a little bit, people notice and start selling. If it goes down, buyers start appearing.
        </p> there are three methods for valuing a company: the income approach, market approach and cost approach. let&#039;s ignore the cost approach -it&#039;s just ajdusted book value. <br>
 <br>
the income approach consists of teh DCF, dividend discount models (which are essentially the same thing), and capitalizing free cash flow. it sounds like you know the basics re the DCF. There are various measures for cash flow. For valuation, you are using either debt-free cash flow or free cash flow to equity. If you&#039;re discount rate is the WACC, use debtfree CF. If it&#039;s just the cost of equity, use FCFE. <br>
 <br>
DFCF = EBIT (1 - tax rate) + Depr/Amort. - CAPX - Net Working capital provisions. <br>
 <br>
FCFE = Net Income + D/A - CAPX - Gross Working Capital +/- Debt Repayments. <br>
 <br>
If you&#039;re capitalizaing cash flow, you want to make normalizing adjustments by adding back nonrecurring expenses, and subtracting out nonrecurring gains. <br>
 <br>
the market approach is applying multiples of earnings/bv/sales/EBITDA or even other metrics like Dollars per Million Customers or whatever to the subject company&#039;s fundamentals. <br>
 <br>
So if you&#039;re valuing a car mfgr - say Ford, Chrysler and GM are trading at an average of 8 times EBITDA. You would maybe make some qualitative adjustments to account for growth, risk and profitability and multiply 8 (ajdusted up or down) by your company&#039;s EBITDA. This gives you enterprise value, so subtract out debt. If you take a multiple of net earnings, don&#039;t subtact debt.  <br>
 <br>
multiples of EBITDA are usually Invested Capital to EBITDA. whereas multiples of net income are usually MV of Equity to NI. <br>
 <br>
you can also use transactional multiples from actual sales of cmopanies as comparables. you can also use rules of thumbs. for example, pipeline companies at one time traded for 6 - 8 times EBITDA. that was the rule w/in the industry. <br>

        </p> For every person who wants to sell a share, someone want to buy a share.  You have to convince the 2 to get together.  If you want to sell more than I want to buy, you will lower your offer until i buy.  If you want to buy more than I want to sell, you will raise your offer until I sell.
