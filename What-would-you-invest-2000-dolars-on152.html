</script><p> Honestly if you are looking at investments look at some mutual funds. They will be one of the best choices for you. They allow you to basically invest in mutiple companies without having to have lots of cash on hand. A lot about investing does deal with your risk tolerance so make sure it is something you are comfortable with and whatever you do just let it sit in your investment so it can grow. If it&#039;s in stocks, bonds, or mutual funds remember markets go up and down. But over time you are virtually guaranteed to make a return greater than that of a cd. By the way the thing with the CD is great, but it barely outpaces inflation. If it doesn&#039;t beat inflation in essence you are losing money.

what would you invest 2000 dolars to make a safe quick gain?
        </p> $2,000 isn&#039;t going to make a whole lot of interest or &quot;gain&quot;. <br>
 <br>
It is such a insignificant amount of money.   <br>
 <br>
If you are willing to take a real gamble, you could try the gold market.  If you are looking to make a big return, then you need to concentrate on high risk investments.   <br>
 <br>
The higher the possibility of a high yield, the higher the risk. <br>
 <br>
Me?  I&#039;d take a nice vacation for about three days.
        </p> $2000 is not much for an investment for a reasonable return. I personally would put it into a CD or money market account and continue to add to it and grow it until it becomes a substantial amount to invest, say $25,000 minimum
        </p> It isn&#039;t really a lot of money when thinking of investments. You could buy some penny stock but that is more like gambling.
        </p> well $2000 is definitely good deal of money. you can try index funds or penny stocks and kind. if you have been following stock market closely they almost every index is gaining. so try to search for some where the brokerage fees are minimal or zero, that way you can get the bang for your buck
        </p> Depends on what you mean by a &quot;quick&quot; gain.  If you mean about 3-6 months I would recommend CDs or money market funds. If you mean a year or longer I would recommend US govt or municipal bonds for a safe gain.
        </p> Combination of ETFs and Government T-Bill. It&#039;s pretty safe. Remember always diversify your portfolio.
        </p> nothing really to tell the truth. $2000 cannot buy much. it&#039;s can pay rent, but it&#039;s not even enough for a down payment.
        </p> Look into a high yeilding 6 month CD.
