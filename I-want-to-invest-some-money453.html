</script><p> Depends on how much money you&#039;ve got. If you don&#039;t have a lot, then shares are probably not for you. Shares are high risk, and you have to be prepared to lose all your money. If you have a lot of money, then it&#039;s worth the risk, since the gains are high. Security is the key to maintaining wealth, and security is found not in shares, but in bonds and savings accounts. <br>
 <br>
The generally accepted investment strategy is to have 25%-75% of your money in shares, 25%-75% in bonds and savings accounts, and maybe 2%-5% in commodities like gold. <br>
 <br>
Of course, if you don&#039;t have a lot to invest in shares then you may find that broker charges will take most of your money. If you do buy shares, make sure you buy into good companies in profitable sectors. <br>
 <br>
There are plenty of savings accounts available from high street banks, so I suggest you shop around for the best rates. Probably best to put your money in more than one of them to ensure you get the best rates. <br>
 <br>
I would also encourage you to consider Zopa as part of your diversified strategy. Zopa is a lending and borrowing exchange that allows you to lend money directly to borrowers with good credit ratings, cutting out the banks and middlemen allowing you to keep the profits. I&#039;m currently getting 7%-11%pa return on investment, which beats a savings account! <br>
 <br>
If you apply via the following link, you get a special offer of £30 free if you lend more than £500. <br>

</script><p> I was in exactly the same position as you a few years ago, I did not have clue where to invest my money but I was referred to a company that has shown me some really great returns and offered an outstanding service, they literally held my hand through the whole process making my first steps into the markets very enjoyable and highly profitable.  If you email me on jessica_peters44@yahoo.co.uk and maybe we can swap numbers.
        </p> I had the same problem as you have. <br>
I had a good amount of money, but didn&#039;t knew where to invest it. <br>
So I looked around for something that gave me a great return towards a low risk. <br>
And the only thing I could find was a mannaged account. <br>
Here you can follow up my results of every day: <br>

My moneymannager is giving me great support, and answer all of my questions almost immediatly. <br>
Annyway feel free to contact me (adress on my blog) and I&#039;ll bring you in direct contact with my money mannager.
        </p> Depends on your age and specialization. If you are young you may be best off investing in some high growth stock because the added risk/reward but if you are older you may want to invest in some bonds. If you have enough money try to speak to a financial advisor about it.
        </p> Invest in Silver. Back in 1980, gold sold for $850 and silver sold for $50. Then, one ounce of gold would buy 17 ounces of silver. Today with gold near $900, one ounce of gold will buy a whopping 55 ounces of silver. It seems to me that silver, in terms of gold, is &quot;too cheap.&quot; <br>
 <br>
The bull run for Gold and Silver has been strong since 2002 making about 40+% annually.  They should both continue to be a great investment in this type of inflationary environment brought on by the weak US dollar, growing deficit, major growth overseas, etc.  We have yet to see the major parabolic phase that puts a final cap on this bull run. <br>
 <br>
You can buy and sell silver at your local coin shop.  I recommend buying 1oz or 10oz bars.  If you have a trading account, you can easily buy and sell silver with ticker symbol &quot;SLV&quot;. The great thing about SLV is you don&#039;t need to store it physically and you can trade it immediately.
        </p> ok depending on the amount of money u r planning on investing i suggest that u look into cd&#039;s (certificates of deposites) which u can obtain in your local banks they r free and the way they work is u give the bank lets say 1000 dollars and they will have u earn a fixed interest rate on that amount for whatever amount of time u want on average its about 5 months though so just look for high rates and if u need more info just email me im a personel finance representative for WAMU
        </p> The main advice is never accept advice from anyone who has not listened to your circumstances and advised you what is relevant for you. <br>
 <br>
There are thousands of investment recommendations out there but only a small number may be suitable for you - take advice!
        </p> Buy premium bonds. There is always the chance that one of your wins will be the million! And you get your money back when you want it. I&#039;ve had a few small wins and think it works out to quite a reasonable percentage rate. <br>
(and I might win the biggie!)
        </p> if you would like to invest in forex, check out this site.  they will provide you with a personal account service manager to guide you and work with you on your trading steps so that you can get the most benefit.
        </p> give it all to meeeeeee!
