</script><p> As has already been stated, a money market fund will give you much lower interest than other funds. However, that doesn&#039;t mean that a money market fund is not profitable. It is important when investing, to have at least 3-6 months of expenditures saved up in a liquid fund ( easily accessible ) for emergencies such as getting laid off, car breaking down, etc. Many investors might suggest a money market fund for such a purpose as a mutual fund that specializes in money market instruments typically have a very short holding time requirement. Other funds will require that you hold your money in their fund for 30-90 days otherwise you pay a penalty for withdrawing funds if needed. In conclusion, a money market fund is an excellent starting choice.  <br>
 <br>
The next step is to find a fund that will allow your money to grow a little with little risk. A lot of investors favour funds that track the performance of the S&amp;P 500 index fund as this fund buys stocks in the top 500 most profitable companies in the US in various sectors, so with one fund you can diversify your entire portfolio and expect a reasonable return as the S&amp;P 500 has historically performed at close to 10% annually.  <br>
 <br>
Then after that you might look into a growth fund, which is a fund that typically buys small-mid capitalization companies that are expected to grow, your funds will grow due to appreciation that is inherent to the rapid growth of smaller companies ( providing the fund buys stocks from companies who will grow at all ). <br>
 <br>
After that then find a fund that specializes in emerging markets. New markets can grow fast and further diversify your portfolio. Finally, to have a well-rounded portfolio, by a REIT fund ( Real Estate Investment Trust ). These funds typically buy stocks from companies who manage malls, apartments, foreclosure properties, rental properties and anything else that might be involved with real estate. People always need land, so real estate is a good investment. If you have the money then you might just consider buying a house instead, a REIT is a nice way to have the profits from real estate without having to spend a lot of money, however owning another house brings you profit from renters which you get to see consistently every month, and if need be, you can always sell the house if you need the money ( although if you keep that money market fund then you should never have to sell anything to get extra money ). <br>
 <br>
By this time I hope I haven&#039;t bored you, but one last thing I will say is that when buying a fund, you should consider a no load and low MER fund ( look for an MER of lower than 1% ). A load is basically a sales commission, there&#039;s front-end and back-end load which applies the commission in different parts of the transaction. An MER is a management expense ratio which is just the fee you pay for the fund manager to manage the fund.

</script><p> A Mutual Fund Investor would always start with a Money Fund,(so don&#039;t feel bad)..If they&#039;re dealing with the Mutual Fund Company and not buying funds thru a Discount Broker.. <br>
 <br>
You&#039;re asking about portfolio allocation, which depends on your age and circumstances.. <br>
Search ...&quot;mutual fund portfolio  allocation&quot;...,. and moneyletter*** <br>
 <br>
A Money Fund is a Cash Core Account where all proceeds of sales of other funds would go . <br>
and  ready again  to quickly buy your next fund pick opportunity..
        </p> Mutual Funds are a thing of the past.  The costs to enter, to exit, and to maintain take so much of the profits.  Over $1T have left mutual funds and are not invested in ETF&#039;s.   Easier to switch ETF&#039;s and the costs are so much less.  Never buy Mutual funds thru a full service broker.
        </p> OMG You picked the worse one to invest your money. <br>
Money Market mutual funds are paying next to nothing in interest. <br>
I would sugest a balanced or asset allocation fund to give you more <br>
divirsification with just a little risk for a better return on your money. <br>
I strongly sugest you read up on how to invest in mutual funds. <br>
