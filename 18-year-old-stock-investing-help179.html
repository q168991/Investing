<h1>18 year old stock investing help?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am an 18 year old who recently put 4000 in my TD Ameritrade account.  I have put 3 grand into Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund.  I have been reading up a lot but im not sure what the best thing to do with my extra 950 bucks I have in cash in my account.  Any suggestions?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

I don&#039;t know if you want to stick with mutual funds or not, and if so I don&#039;t know if you&#039;d consider another fund family. However, if you&#039;re open to new families, I&#039;ve done a lot of research on the PIMCO Income Fund. It&#039;s got great yields and good returns, and is rated very well. Only requires $1k minimum, so maybe throw another $50 in the account?  <br>
 <br>
Equities that I&#039;ve had good luck with include Novavax (NVAX), an early stage vaccine company--seems to constantly break its own records--and it&#039;s a bargain.
