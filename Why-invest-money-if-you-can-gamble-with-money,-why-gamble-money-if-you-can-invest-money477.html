</script><p> In gambling you cold lose all your money in one night or one hour,but in investment specially in Mutual Fund you could ride out your loss and wait for the bull to regain or increase your investment,which is impossible in gambling. <br>
You can also apply this with stock or share,but there is more risk because the company or Industry may declare bankrupt and you can lose all your money or part of it,but this is highly unlikely with Big-Cap stock. <br>
All business can be consider a bit like gambling e.g you take a business loan of 5 Lakh at 16% PA  you rent a store at 7000 per month,so you are taking a risk of losing your collateral if you can&#039;t pay your loan. <br>
But all thing consider the fastest and easiest way to lose all your money is through gambling and not through other investment.
        </p> While investing and gambling are very similar in many ways , the key difference is that the risks involved with investing are very much more calculated. There are many forms investing and many forms of gambling. As a professional investor I can tell you the motive is not nearly as much greed as it is , ambition for a better life for me and my family. I am 32 years old and have not had a &#039;job&#039; for seven years. I started my own business and began investing in Real Estate ( I also &#039;gamble&#039; on a few stocks ) Why work hard for your money when you can have your money work hard for you. Too many people work hard all of their lives without ever getting anywhere. The need for people to learn how to create residual income has never been greater. With the technology available today we have made a transition from the &#039;industrial age&#039; to the &#039;information age&#039;. Hard work is great as long as you are taking care of your own business not somebody else&#039;s. In a job you work countless hours with little vacation time and may or may not be able to retire comfortably when you are a senior citizen. Owning a business or at least investing in some form is quickly becoming a necessity for anyone who desires a better life and much more time to enjoy with your family. There has never been a better time than right now to begin to invest in yourself. For this reason I have added an additional feature to one of my websites. This allows people an opportunity to create residual income and start your own business. There is a wealth of knowledge and resources available , from publishing a book you have written to starting your own on-line business in five minutes complete with a customizable website. You can invest in yourself and start right now for $75 - $100 <br>

        </p> Well, you can throw your money away at gambling, or you can invest your money in low risk mutual funds for a sure return. <br>
 <br>
If you think investing is all about greed, then you can just not invest and live off of social insecurity from 65 to age 90, or age 65 until you get sick and cannot afford the medical costs. <br>
 <br>
It&#039;s your decision.
        </p> Well they both are similar in the sense that they both require skill to make money. <br>
 <br>
But in investing, there are very many different types of investments, and according to the type there can be little to no risk.  <br>
 <br>
For example,. if you purchase a GIC, there is no risk of losing your money but it is still considered an investment. <br>
 <br>
 But on the other hand, if you invest in derivatives then it can be pretty risky. Something like this can be more accurately compared to gambling, but if you know your stuff, it can be much less riskier than gambling. <br>
 <br>
so in short, investing and gambling are pretty different things
        </p> Gambling is more like a luck game. Wealthy people gamble to kill their time. Less wealthy people gamble to take on the chance to become wealthy.  <br>
 <br>
Investing is more like a learn-able art. The more we practice, the better we will be. We will look for companies which could generate income consistently and progressively. <br>
 <br>
Both have risk. One with calculated risk and the other with sheer luck.
        </p> You might, but don&#039;t forget, casinos can ban you from playing if you win too much. They have the right to refuse you for any reason, and winning is one of them. And once you&#039;re banned at one, your face will be in the database of every major casino on earth. They all talk and share info, and they&#039;re quite scary if you&#039;re on their bad side. So, unfortunately, this may be fun but short-lived. If, however, you can use this technique in games against other gamblers, not the house, you could probably do it forever. The casinos know the odds of winning on any game, down to the millionth percentile. Anyone who is beating those odds too consistently is presumed to be cheating, or counting cards, or whatever. Doesn&#039;t matter. They have every legal right to prevent people from winning too often. Go out and buy &quot;Busting Vegas&quot; by Ben Mezrich. It&#039;s a book about a bunch of MIT math whizzes that nailed the casinos in blackjack for a short time. Nothing they did was actually illegal, but they had a very scary ending to their fun. Easy quick read, and pretty darn interesting. It might open your eyes a bit about the possible consequences of your business plan. Good luck.
