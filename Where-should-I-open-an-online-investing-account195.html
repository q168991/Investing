</script><p> Im not going to talk for everyone else but ive had a positive experience with scottrade as my online broker. They charge $7 trades and have really good customer service. They aslo have physical locations which is a plus for me because it means i dont have to mail checks across the country in order to start my account. <br>
 <br>
And yes i start with 800 bucks.

</script><p> I use http://sogoinvest.excellentabc*** and think they would be a good choice for you since you don&#039;t have a lot to invest.  The most you will pay per trade is $3 which is much lower than the other online brokers plus they let you buy fractions of shares which will be of help with your low initial investment.  The low fees will help preserve the capital in your account.  Plus they have a promo running where you pay only $1 per trade for the first 90 days of your account.  Wish I could get this! <br>
 <br>
Hope this helps and good luck trading.
        </p> 1 months and two weeks ago with $200 now I am at 600 now I was up to 700 but the feb 27 correction took me down to 500.You must get Stock Investing for Dummies, and 24 Essential Lessons for Investment Success these books are worth every penny.Also you are going to want to set up an online account to better understand what they are talking about in the books you will have visual picture. do not set up margin account I have the best online broker there is and they are very cheap. If you email me I will send you right to them and let you know how to set it up and you don&#039;t have to deposit money till you are ready. my email is franksprung@yahoo*** I do get 50 dollars for referals but they are the best and I am more than happy with there service. I can help you out finding the things you will need to know on the site.
        </p> I started with even less than that many years ago using BuyandHold***. They are great and I still use them. They are by far the cheapest. $14.99/month for unlimited trading or $2.99 per trade. It&#039;s easy to use and it&#039;s not as cumbersome as Sharebuilder. With just $500 you&#039;re going to lose a fortune paying $7 on each trade (or more.) I wouldn&#039;t go with a larger broker until you&#039;ve got at least $10,000 to invest. Otherwise the trading fees will kill your returns.
        </p> Scottrade is good. However, I would suggest going to computershare*** and buying directly from the company. You save on commissions and can get dividends reinvested. You can choose companies like Pfizer, Exxon....and probably a few hundred more
