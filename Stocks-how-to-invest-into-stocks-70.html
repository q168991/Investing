</script><p> Best way would be to first start a brokerage account. I recommend either Etrade or Scottrade. Then books to read are &quot;When Markets Collide.&quot; Fabulous book. Also read articles on Yahoo/Google Finance. A really good site a like for tips and articles Stocks on Wall Street as they just make it easy for any investor to understand which stocks to buy/sell and they also write good articles on the Markets. The link is below. <br>

Good luck! You will never regret investing in the stock market.
        </p> There was a study done with monkeys, kindergardners and stock brokers. <br>
 <br>
kindergardners picked the stocks they knew: Disney, toys&#039;r&#039;us, etc. <br>
Stock brokers did it their way. Ststistics, etc. <br>
And the monkeys picked stocks by throwing darts at a wall.. <br>
 <br>
long story short.... <br>
stock brokers came in last. monkeys second, and kindergardners came in first... <br>
 <br>
Pick stocks you know of and buy products from.
        </p> I recommend HSFX Asset Management, search them in google.. <br>
over 3% profits per month, not bad..
        </p> Learn about the world around you before you decide to throw your money out the window. It takes years to understand..
        </p> Dude are you crazy
        </p> Please do your own homework. Just like the rest of us.
