<h1>College student planning to invest in stock market.?</h1>
<div class="answer">I&amp;#39;m a 21 year old college student with about 2 grand left over at the end of the year. I&amp;#39;m looking to get a head start for next year and years ahead for money. I have watched the stock market for some time now but not sure really which stocks have a big chance for me gaining some money in the long run and possibly help with my education housing and finances. I plan on working anyways so this money I can throw into the stock market somewhat. If there is anything new out there cheap or something that plans on making a big boom in a year or two or sooner let me know because I would love to invest! 
Thank you!<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Longer term, the demographic trend is the Baby Boomers are retiring.  They need healthcare and medicines.   <br>
 <br>
I particularly like ACL, Alcon, eye related products.  It&#039;s at $147 with a one year target of $175, according to Yahoo Finance. <br>
 <br>
I also like PBR, Petrobras, Brazilian oil.  PBR has increased 6x in the past 5 years and might increase another 6x in the next 5 years.  That&#039;s 36x in 10 years. <br>
 <br>
Historically, very few companies can match that multiple. <br>

        </p> ok, ok, what is your plan for investing in the stock market?  do you intend to buy and hold or trade? are you looking for short term gains or long term gains? <br>
 <br>
something cheap.- The problem with cheap is that it may not be around for long. what you need to be concerned about it Gains in % to your float.  as an example a long term investor is doing well if they make 10-15% per year.  so as means that with your $5000 that you may get about $500-$750 in the first year. <br>
 <br>
Best thing i can tell you is to read books and study websites about investing or Trading!!  and dont  go for &quot;Systems&quot; with promises of HUGE Gains, they are far riskier then they make out.
        </p> You should invest in something you know well of and can trust.  Like say if you like and own a couple items of Nike, then you should look up how its doing in the market and see if its something your willing to risk.  I myself am a college student and plan to do the same thing this summer.  Just make sure you don&#039;t invest in something that you don&#039;t trust or know nothing of.  Hope this helps =]
        </p> Stocks...Open a Discount Broker account,..Go Super Conservative to Start(Large-Cap Mutual Funds bought in a Major Correction)..Best of Luck..
        </p> With your thought process on this you may as well go to a casino. You are basically doing the same thing with your attitude about finding &quot;something cheap&quot; or &quot;a big boom.&quot; Also, $2,000 is not enough to do anything with - even if you made a 50% return (unlikely in today&#039;s market, maybe a year ago but not today), with commissions you would have less than $1,000 profit.
        </p> Freddie Mac! That would be my number one pick. It&#039;ll take about 5 years in my opinion for this stock to reach its peak, but right now it&#039;s very low. Great price to buy in. Also AIG. I&#039;d buy their stock if you see it dip down around $28. Google would be great stock to buy as well. Don&#039;t be frightened by how few shares you might get for only $2,000. The ratio of your return will still be the same, and I anticipate their next fiscal year could be one of their most profitable years yet as a public company.
        </p> This is the time to buy at every decline. Buy blue chip stocks at every decline and sell them in short term. Again buy stocks at the right opportunity. However before doing anything understand market and all the risk involved. gather maximum information as much as you can only thn think about it

It&#039;s Rubicon Minerals. They have the best undeveloped gold property on the planet right now. It&#039;s called the Phoenix Gold Project in Ontario Canada if ya want to look into it. The stock is about $3.60-3.70 right now. <br>
These guys will be a giant gold producer in a few years and you&#039;re looking at a $30+ stock. <br>
It&#039;s guaranteed to beat any other suggestions you get here.  <br>
I had 7000 shares in my IRA and have been trading it. Right now I think it should be accumulated. If it goes lower just buy more. These guys are going to be big. Their gold grades (grams per ton) are the best anywhere on the planet. Find me another property with higher grades and I&#039;ll buy you shares. RBY is the best. Theyt just need a few years to get into production.  <br>
Just buy now. Thank me later.;-)

This means learning how it works, learning how to read charts and learning how you can make accurate predictions. All these are not that difficult but it takes some time. If you treat it as gambling and just make random predictions then you will obviously not win.

         I would look at some of the Chinese ADR.  Swing for the fences with some chance of making a high risk-reward investment work for you.  You are young and should be taking chances at your age vs. 30 years form now.
