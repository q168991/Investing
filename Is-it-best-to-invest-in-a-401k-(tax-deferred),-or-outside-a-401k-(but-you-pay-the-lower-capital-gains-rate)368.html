<h1>Is it best to invest in a 401k (tax-deferred), or outside a 401k (but you pay the lower capital gains rate)?</h1>
<div class="answer">Does it make sense to contribute more to a 401k than the portion an employer matches?

On one hand; it grows and compounds on a tax-deferred basis.
But: Doesn&amp;#39;t that mean you pay a higher tax rate (since it&amp;#39;s taxed as ordinary income and not capital gains)?  

Is it worth it to put your money into a 401k or better invested outside of it?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> most people need to do both if they want a decent retirement. the annual limit for 401(k), in my opinion, is FAR too low. you should fund a Roth IRA also. <br>
 <br>
for me personally, maxing out the 401(k) each year requires little beyond what it takes to get full employer match.

</script><p> The question is not easy and it depnds on what your investments are going to be and how you are going to handle those investments.  There is no question that if you are going to buy an hold a mountain of growth stock for 30 years, you would almost surely be better off doing it outside your retirement funds so your gains are taxed as capital gains instead of income.  The problem is that means you have serious trouble diversifying and balancing your portfolio without paying taxes unless your income is growing so that you can diversify and balance with new purchases.   <br>

Contrary to what the previous poster says, I can tell you a lot about your retirement planning by what you are doing now.  Of course, that changes and you may need flexibility to change.  That &quot;Nobody knows therefore you can&#039;t do anything about it&quot; is always and everywhere just dumb.
        </p> As previously noted, if you get ANY kind of a match from your employer, you should make sure to take it all! That&#039;s FREE extra money! <br>
 <br>
After that, if you are under 30, a Roth is a good idea, over 30 a regular IRA... <br>
 <br>
BTW, neither you nor I nor the Man in the Moon know what your ordinary Income Tax rate is going to be when you retire!
        </p> Many new investors are lured to the appeal of a penny stock due to the low price and potential for rapid growth which may be as high as several hundred percent in a few days.  <br>

Similarly, severe loss can occur and many penny stocks lose all of their value in the long term. Accordingly, the SEC warns that penny stocks are high risk investments and new investors should be aware of the risks involved but you can even make very big money. These risks include limited liquidity, lack of financial reporting, and fraud. A penny stock is a common stock that trades for less than $5 a share. While penny stocks generally are quoted over-the-counter, such as on the OTC Bulletin Board or in the Pink Sheets, they may also trade on securities exchanges, including foreign securities exchanges. In addition, penny stocks include the securities of certain private companies with no active trading market. Although a penny stock is said to be &quot;thinly traded,&quot; share volumes traded daily can be in the hundreds of millions for a sub-penny stock. Legitimate information on penny stock companies can be difficult to find and a stock can be easily manipulated.
        </p> I retailer roughly 20-30% of my pay. I put half into retirement plans and half into other financial savings. 1. Putting all of right into a tax deferred plan is a significant risk should you wouldn&#039;t have emergency funds. 2. I&#039;ve met folks who put a lot into the tax deferred plans that their tax price in retirement is definitely better than when they put the cash in. As for capital positive factors, planning on them is overrated. The inventory market does now not warranty a ten% expense of return. Mainly now with all of the wannabe day-merchants messing round with the market.
