<h1>Stock market investing, investing options?</h1>
<div class="answer">i know about Bonds, CDs, money market, property, the stock market. roughly speaking. my questions are more so of the who,what,when, where, and hows to invest. not such much the when because i want to start now, i know this is a game based off of &amp;quot; When&amp;quot; but i would like my when to begin so preferably on my next min wage pay check so that should kind of put in perspective how much im working with. i live in spartanburg, sc so any advice on this situation would be great and im only 20 so i&amp;#39;m not afraid of high risk opportunities, simply put ive been throwing money away for a while. any good advice answering the who,what,when,where, why, and how would be great. thankyou. looking for both fast and slow growths as far as returns go.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> If you take a look at what academia says, it&#039;s not a matter of when but a matter of probabilities, value and risks.   The Black Scholes equation has demonstrated how valuable probabilities are, portfolio balance has demonstrated the importance of risks and of course you always want a good price for the value.   If you keep thinking it&#039;s about when, you&#039;re likely to paint yourself into a trap. <br>
 <br>
Ben Graham says that the ideal mix is 45% equity, 55% bonds.   Claude Shannon at MIT demonstrated that between a random walk as a &quot;stock&quot; and cash, the optimal balance is always 50 / 50.   Markowitz with his efficient frontier and tangential method typically lands you with an optimal balance just shy of 50% equity.   So where does this be aggressive when young come from? <br>
 <br>
When you are young, you will hopefully be contributing something from each paycheck to your investments.   This is in fact the same as holding a bond in your investments and you can even calculate the value of the bond if you have a suitable market rate of return.   A suitable market rate of return may be your employer&#039;s corporate bond yield as that includes the default risk of your employer in a risk premium.   For example, if you are committed to depositing $466 a month at the end of the month for the next 40 years and you use 7% per annum as your market rate, you effectively have the equivalent of a bond worth $466 / 1.07^( 1 / 12 ) * ( 1 - 1 / 1.07^40 ) / ( 1 - 1 / 1.07^( 1 / 12 ) ) = $76,913.54 so you can in fact invest aggressively before reaching the 50 / 50 mark or whatever point you&#039;ve determined as optimal. <br>
 <br>
Where does the statement &quot;determine your risk tolerance&quot; come from.   There&#039;s a battle between mathematicians, physicists and engineers who prefer to use a cardinal utility of wealth like the log utility of wealth to model risk with investments and economists like Samuelson who insist that wealh can not be a cardinal system but must be ordinal therefore risk can only be measured by human judgement.   This latter view has been misinterpreted as a degree of personal risk tolerance which has served to sell investment products to people but has nothing to do with the success of your portfolio.   Whether or not you are comfortable with the risk, excess risk can still wipe you out.

</script><p> To get higher returns, you have to accept higher risk. <br>
 <br>
Don&#039;t start buying individual stocks.  You are competing against investment professionals, and you will not win.  Buy a maket index ETF like QQQ, which invests in an index and has very low fees.  You are investing in the market as a whole.  Or, buy a mutual fund, and you pay a fee (a percentage of your money) to the managers for picking your stocks.  If you think that you can choose the professional that will pick stocks better than all the other professionals, then buy a mutual fund, and the increased return will be worth the increased fees.  Do not fool yourself into thinking that you can pick stocks better than the pros.  If there was a high-return, low-risk investment, the pros would already have jumped on it, bidding up the price until the expeected return matched the expected risk. <br>
 <br>
Open a Roth IRA.  Put money into it.  You will not get a tax deduction now, but the money will grow tax-free, and when you take the money out, you won&#039;t pay tax on it.  Your tax rate when you retire is almost certainly going to be higher than your tax rate now, so this is a good deal.  (If you think your tax rate will be lower in retirement, put your money into a regular IRA, which gives you a deduction now, but the money is taxed as regular income now when you take it out at retirement.) <br>
 <br>
Put the money into an index ETF like QQQ. <br>
 <br>
DO NOT sell every time the market drops.  You want to buy low and sell high, and selling when the market drops is the opposite of that.
