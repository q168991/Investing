</script><p> Investing is a life long endeavor. the basics can be easily mastered, but most people confuse &#039;trading&#039; with &#039;investing&#039;.  <br>
 <br>
those in their 20&#039;s and 30&#039;s must become very proficient at accumulating and investing wealth, more so then any generation before. <br>
 <br>
Yahoo finance is as good a place as any to learn the basics  <br>
http://finance.yahoo***/education/begin... <br>
http://finance.yahoo***/etf/education <br>
http://finance.yahoo***/bonds/bonds_101 <br>
 <br>
My only advise is don&#039;t listen to anyone here or on TV about WHAT to invest in. The following are some practical steps to get you on your way to LEARN for yourself. <br>
 <br>
step 1. <br>
First decide what kind of brokerage you want to work with. You can open a brokerage account in your bank, with a large full service brokerage or an internet brokerage. I find when I get help, most people want to sell me things that are better for them…. So I use http://***scottrade*** because it’s cheap and easy with low frills. I like their streaming quotes and I do my own research and make my own investments. But any low cost internet brokerage service is fine. <br>
 <br>
Step 2. get a subscription to Barrons or Investors Business Daily… Do this for 6 months or a year. At first, It seems a bit mysterious, but pretty soon you start to understand the terms and things that investors are looking for and what they are afraid of <br>
 <br>
Step 3. If you have some money to invest, put it in 3 month CD’s right now. First the market is unstable and second you have some homework in Step 4 to do before you do any investing. <br>
 <br>
Step 4. Go out to the internet and search on the following subjects. Become very familiar with the concepts. <br>
Asset allocation  <br>
Long term investing <br>
inflation   <br>
Roth ira vs ira <br>
Large med small cap <br>
Value vs growth <br>
Indexed mutual funds <br>
No load mutual funds <br>
ETF <br>
Sector funds <br>
Bonds CD preferred stock <br>
dividends <br>
International funds <br>
Market cycles <br>
volatility <br>
Fundamental analysis <br>
Technical analysis <br>
In most cases, I think it is wise to use indexed mutual funds and ETF to build the base of your portfolio. <br>
 <br>
Step 5 go to http://clearstation.etrade***/ and sign up for a free account. Play around there by looking at graphs and fundamentals. If you click on the graph names, you will get clear information about what the graph is based on and how to interpret it. I think it’s also a good idea to pretend you have $10,000 and start buying and selling on paper. Keep track of where you are each day for a month… It’s a lot easier to lose play money then real money…. <br>
WARNING: don’t rely on technical analysis alone. These graphs are good at telling you WHEN to buy and sell, but now WHAT to buy. <br>
 <br>
Step 6. It’s always a good Idea to see a CFP (certified financial planner). Their job is to work for your benefit, not to sell you investments. They can cover subjects like employee benefits, insurance, budgeting, living trusts, 401k, taxes and real estate as well as investment types and investment types to keep away from. <br>
 <br>
Always strive to do your own research… you’ll find everyone sounds like an expert so take everything people tell you with a grain of salt. It’s not easy in the beginning but soon you will be the expert. <br>
 <br>
Don’t get involved with futures, currency, options (unless you get stock options at work), commodities, annuities or other derivative type investments at this time. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Good Luck
