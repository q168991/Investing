</script><p> Pulled from wikipedia: Investment or investing[1] is a term with several closely-related meanings in business management, finance and economics, related to saving or deferring consumption. Investing is the active redirection of resources: from being consumed today, to creating benefits in the future; the use of assets to earn income or profit.[2] An investment is a choice by an individual or an organization such as a pension fund, after at least some careful analysis or thought, to place or lend money in a vehicle (e.g. property, stock securities, bonds) that has sufficiently low risk and provides the possibility of generating returns over a period of time.[3] Placing or lending money in a vehicle that risks the loss of the principal sum or that has not been thoroughly analyzed is, by definition speculation, not investment.[4] <br>
 <br>
The easiest way to explain investing is as so: You are taking a chance on a companies success. If they grow their stocks (Your investment) is worth more. Likewise if the company fails or is unable to grow, you will lose money. Before you blindly look into investing I suggest doing more research. There are a lot of free and paid resources that can teach you about the stock market and how it works. I have created a website to help by reviewing some of the paid programs.

</script><p> Investment or investing[1] is a term with several closely-related meanings in business management, finance and economics, related to saving or deferring consumption. An asset is usually purchased, or equivalently a deposit is made in a bank, in hopes of getting a future return or interest from it. The word originates in the Latin &quot;vestis&quot;, meaning garment, and refers to the act of putting things (money or other claims to resources) into others&#039; pockets. See Invest. The basic meaning of the term being an asset held to have some recurring or capital gains. It is an asset that is expected to give returns without any work on the asset per se
        </p> Maybe consider a savings account, or a CD if you get  a bit more money. The stock market can be a good investment, but you often need a bit more than what you have to start investing in stocks. And make it worthwhile.
        </p> According to the Merriam-Webster Online Dictionary: invest - to commit (money) in order to earn a financial return. <br>
 <br>
Investing can be a complex subject as it has a wide array of financial products for individual to choose.  It can range from the simplest form such as your savings account.  Let&#039;s say the bank pays an interest of 2% on your savings deposit of $150 annually, then on the anniversary date of your deposit, the bank will pay you $3.  So your savings will now be $153.  It means that you have made a profit of $3 on your initial investment of $150. <br>
 <br>
I suggest that you look for more information before you decide to invest your hard-earned money.
        </p> Start reading good investment books, and do NOT be fooled by the majority of &quot;get rich quick&quot; websites floating around the web. Here is a trusted source of investment books to read: <br>

Good luck!
        </p> Why do you want to do something when you don&#039;t know what it is? <br>
Invest-pretty much comes with a certain amount of risk. <br>
You could make money-but then again, you could lose some or all of it. <br>
&quot;Invest&quot; some time at the library or here on-line and do some research.
