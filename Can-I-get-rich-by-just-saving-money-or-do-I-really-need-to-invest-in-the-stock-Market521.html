<h1>Can I get rich by just saving money or do I really need to invest in the stock Market?</h1>
<div class="answer">I hear the only people making money on Wall Street are the &amp;quot;White shoe boys&amp;quot; on Wall Street.  Your opinions?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> People have gotten rich purely on bond investments alone but they are also not without risk even though they are contracts (bonds) for a defined return.   With any contract, there is always the possibility that the parties simply can not live up to their obligations.   The stock market offers the best opportunity for a return short of actual entrepreneurialism, the stock market allows you to share in the benefits of other people&#039;s entrepreneurialism.   However, you don&#039;t have to learn to pick stocks or trade to become rich.   Just investing in a no load, low fee index fund beats out half the investors out there so you can simply dollar cost average into an index fund effectively investing in the entire market.   You can do a little better by splitting your regular contributions between an index fund and a bond fund, perhaps in a 50/50 split and rebalancing your portfolio annually and or after any major changes in the market.   If you are truly risk averse, a portfolio of 25% stock and 75% bonds has the lowest risk, lower than a 100% bond portfolio even though it has higher returns.   There are &quot;risk free&quot; investments such as CD&#039;s, savings accounts and treasury bonds but they are only risk free because of deposit insurance, the treasury bonds are considered risk free because they are backed by the full force of the US government.   The problem with the &quot;risk free&quot; investments are that they rarely keep up with inflation.

</script><p> The quickest way to get rich is through owning your own business. Financial experts like Warren Buffett, Donald Trump and Former President Bill Clinton all said network marketing is what they would do today if they had to start over. <br>
 <br>
It is true that network marketing has a bad reputation, but it is because most people join a company and then quit after 3 or 4 months because they aren&#039;t rich yet. If a person is patient they can be very successful at network marketing and it only takes up a small amount of time.  <br>
 <br>
I just joined a network marketing company that costs $12 a month in product purchase to stay active. The best part of this company is, they pay their members from the $12 per month product purchase and that means nobody has to sell anything. It is the best non hassle opportunity I have seen. <br>
 <br>
I would be happy to give you more info if you desire.
        </p> My friend if you have depends if you have a normal income, if you work anywhere  or you got a business. If you got a business i suggest you spend little and save more that&#039;s a big secret in becoming rich its the only way no way becoming rich if you get some money and buy a lot of Louis Vuitton bags for your wife :)). Investing in the stock market is risky as you can loose what you invest and you might also become bankrupt i don&#039;t suggest you doing that.
        </p> Well. Stock Market is very risky market. It can make you rich in a go and fall you down in a go. No body will suggest you to dive in stock if you don&#039;t have understanding. For this you must first learn , learn as a beginner that knows nothing and once you have enough knowledge first try to play with mock ups and then start with investing small money that you can afford to lose. <br>
 <br>
I will also suggest you a site http://***appliedfx*** This site has a lot of articles that help amateurs and other people who want to start foreign currency exchanging or want to find information about it.
        </p> unfortunately the problem with saving is it takes a lifetime or more to get to a level that one would call rich.   <br>
 <br>
for example it takes (on ave) 40yrs to reach 1 million dollars cash.  and that is consistant deposits.  now 1 million isnt a lot of money in many western countries and in 40yrs it will probably have much less buying power.    <br>
 <br>
Think about how many houses 1 milion buys now compared with only 10-20 yrs ago.   <br>
 <br>
Investment is important, but there are 3 main areas,  Business /  Real Estate  / Stocks.  If you want success learn how
        </p> People that get rich in the stock market are people that know what they are doing.  The people who aren&#039;t getting rich from it, go into without bothering to learn anything.  Take the time to learn and learn from those that are doing it already...people like Warren Buffet, Peter Lynch.. read their books, study what they do, take the time to learn about money and how it works etc etc.  Savings in a bank are only good to accumulate enough to invest.
        </p> You can not get rich by just saving money.  That is an undeniable fact.  If you want to get rich you have either got to work your way into richness or invest your way into richness.  It helps to actually do both.  You do not have to invest in the stock market.  You could invest into other things such as a business, real estate, etc.
        </p> Investment in a good market is a way to get the financial stability in the future. stocks, gold, silver, real estate as well as tax lien certificates are just few good investments. having a business coach who can give you the advice in starting up your business is an advantage.
        </p> In the long run, you will loose money if you do not invest in the stock market because of inflation. <br>
Investing in mutual funds or ETF is a good way to be inflation hedged.
        </p> You definitely have to invest, but not necessarily in the stock market.

         Well, where will you put that money you are saving?  Most people put a large portion of their savings into stock mutual funds.
        </p> Depends on how much you can save every month.
