<h1>Small Business Investing?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am a potential small business owner, in the process of finishing my business plan and seeking funding. I have a few investors that want to invest some money in my store, but I want to know how that works. If a person invest $10,000 in my company who and what determines how much they get back and when they get it back? What are the terms and agreement, and if I make the terms how do I do that, where do I start?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> There cant be a 100% specific answer without knowing the deal.  Anyway, you can study the deals done by private equity and venture capital firms (google about it and do some research) to know how the deal is oriented and how are the terms and conditions laid out.  Study how other entrepreneurs make such deals.   <br>

Generally, investors seek a percentage of profits (depending on their investments) and sell their stake depending upon their investment philosophy.
