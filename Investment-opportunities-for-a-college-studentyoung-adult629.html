<h1>Investment opportunities for a college student/young adult?</h1>
<div class="answer">Hey folks:

I&amp;#39;m a second semester Freshman this year at VCU (Go Rams!) I&amp;#39;ve got a great job that I love, and I currently live at home with my parents, who want me to stay until around this time next year. I&amp;#39;m wondering about some investment opportunities, and the best way to get a little &amp;quot;emergency cushion&amp;quot; set up, starting now, so that I can have a couple months&amp;#39; rent by next year, just in case.

My current financial situation: 

Work 28hrs a week. Paid every two weeks -- about $560.00 before taxes (likely $455 MINIMUM after taxes,) 

Student (CampusEdge) Checking Account with Bank of America. 

Basically, what I want to do is start saving, but I want a decent interest rate (Bank of America is offering only 0.05% APY on their site, and I&amp;#39;ve seen a LOT better from banks like Ally,) so can anyone recommend a good place to start a savings account? And if it&amp;#39;s an online bank, would it be safe, even if their FDIC insured?

Secondly: at what point should I start investing (after I have some money saved up,) and what would be a good mid- to (preferably) long-term investment? A Money Market account? I&amp;#39;d open a few CDs, but I don&amp;#39;t have that kind of money available right now. Wanna save that for my &amp;quot;cushion.&amp;quot;

Any help or advice on solid savings accounts and good investment opportunities would be appreciated!<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Actually, CDs are very poor now in interest, and with inflation you would essentially be losing money (not to mention having it locked away without access unless you want big penalties). Also you should keep your money OUT of those big banks for investments since they charge very high expense ratios, loads (sales charges) and rip-off 12b-1 fees.  <br>
 So if you want something safe like a CD I&#039;d say look at ***bankrate*** and choose the best CD you can find for a period you like (or ladder multiple CDs for different periods to be safer). But if you want something with more return with moderate risk, try looking at something like a GNMA fund or Total Bond Index Fund. Many places allow you to write checks off of them if over about $250 when you need to immediately pay for something. Minimum investment requirements vary according to the place, but look at Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, and Schwab. <br>
 If you are thinking of long term and retirement, consider a Roth IRA. Your money grows tax free, and when you retire you can withdraw it tax free as well. There are Target Retirement funds that automatically adjust their allocation as you get older from stocks to bonds to lock in your gains. <br>
 If you are thinking of a 5 year or longer investment then you are generally looking at stocks. Make sure you have enough savings though for about 6 months on your own first though. And getting rid of any debt should also be a high priority. <br>
If you want to get into the market but don&#039;t know what stock to pick, I would choose an index fund or ETF. Instead of throwing all your eggs into one basket (one company), index funds can invest you in dozens, hundreds, or thousands of companies all at once and so there is less risk. This protects you if any one company or industry runs into trouble. For bonds, the returns are less, but more solid. <br>
For more information, try looking at <br>
https://personal.vanguard***/us/funds/v... <br>
and play with it, comparing funds with more or less risk. <br>
 <br>
Do some reading online such as  <br>
http://***vanguard***/us/insights <br>
and <br>
http://***clarkhoward*** <br>
and books like Investing for Dummies for a good intro.

        </p> I believe that Bank of America has an account where you can invest in securities directly through their web login, and thereby put your money in bonds, stocks or whatever else will give you a better return.   You should be able to find municipal and corporate bonds that give you rates of 2% to 5% quite readily and though not all would be insured, some investment products like certain municipal bonds do carry private insurance.   You can also just invest in a total market indexed fund, proportioning your money in a 50/50 split between the fund and relatively risk free bonds such that you can take advantage of market swings by simply rebalancing back to 50/50 thereby buying low and selling high.    <br>
 <br>
At some point, you will have to accumulate enough money to invest in the respective securities, for example the Continenta Airlines hasl bonds maturing next year, it is a BB rated bond (BBB is the lowest investment grade so this does qualify as a junk bond but Continental has proven to be a survivor in the past) that will give you over 2% yield to maturity (pretty hard to get good rates over short periods of time) but the minimum purchase would be 5 bonds at about $1,040 each.    <br>
 <br>
Even if you don&#039;t have the money for investment opportunities, you should develop the discipline to proportion your paycheck and set aside a defined percentage for the purpose of investing, if nothing else open another savings account for that purpose with the same bank and set the nickname to be &quot;to invest&quot; and allow it to accumulate to where you can invest.   If you don&#039;t start now despite the low dollar amounts, you&#039;ll never start. <br>
 <br>
An emergency fund or cushion needs to be liquid as it&#039;s purpose is to be there such that you do not have to make an unfavourable investment decision when you need the money.   Unfortunately that limits your options as to what to keep the emergency fund in but keep in mind that the sooner you accumulate an emergency fund, the sooner you can start putting the cash flow into your investment fund.
        </p> 401K first. If your company matches make sure you put the max of the company match. You can put (I think), up to 16% of your salary into a 401K. If you can put more away, open up a ROTH. Do not open a ROTH at a local bank - they will overwhelm you with fees. Go through a discount broker like Fidelity, Scott trade, or Schwab. /
