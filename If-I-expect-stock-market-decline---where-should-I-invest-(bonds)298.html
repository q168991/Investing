</script><p> The interest rate has a small tendency to decline during stock market declines, because there is a &quot;flight to safety&quot;, making bonds more valuable.  But this is not necessarily the case. <br>
 <br>
If you REALLY believe the market will decline, you can buy something like &quot;SDS&quot;, which is engineered to move opposite to the market.  This is, however, quite risky, and certainly not recommended for the long term.  You should realize that you don&#039;t actually KNOW what the market is going to do---no one does, and to believe that you do is just gambling.  Investing is buying companies whose business you believe in---you&#039;re becoming an owner of a productive, ongoing concern. <br>
 <br>
The conservative thing to do is to keep your money in a money market fund and buy stocks at regular intervals as time goes on.  This will cushion you against short-term market fluctuations.

</script><p> Lets think about this a little.  Nothing over long periods will beat an investment in the stock market.  If the market goes down what will eventually happen to it?  THE ANSWER TO TO QUESTION IS QUITE SIMPLE - IF THE MARKET GOES DOWN INVEST MORE INTO THE MARKET!  Investing is not a do it yourself project.  You should seek the help of an investment professional.  By the way investing in bonds is NEVER a solution.  I would love to chat further with you about this.   Please email me at richardjackel2000@yahoo***

The lower the Stock Market goes the higher this ETFs goes.
        </p> the main inexpensive way is thru a cyber web broking service like Scottrade, Etrade, or Ameritrade. The trades are relatively affordable, and you will arise to the 2nd inventory tips. From my adventure, Scottrade is a superb for $4000, at the same time as Etrade could be greater appropriate in case you intend on making an investment 6 figures or greater.
        </p> Why do the stock market decline? Different reason has different effect
        </p> if you a novice investor, it is better to stay away from the market for a while. but if you &#039;used&#039; to stock market, then i second to Mr AntDU, short the stock. either way, you can still make money in stock market.
        </p> There are ETFs (exchange-traded funds) that go up when the market goes down.  I own SRS, SKF, and QID.  Here is a like to my portfolio: <br>

        </p> Then short the market.  If you feel it is going down go short.
        </p> Stocks for the longterm.
