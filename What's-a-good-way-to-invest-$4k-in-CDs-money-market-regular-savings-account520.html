<div class="answer">This is money that I sincerely doubt I will need in less than a years&amp;#39; time, but I would hope to have some kind of access within 3 years. I don&amp;#39;t have a job, but I may get a summer jobs (this is so you can tell me what to plan regarding taxes). I don&amp;#39;t want something that COULD necessarily make too much money, just enough to pay for the taxes.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Assuming you&#039;re in the US ?  If you go to Bankrate***, you can look up savings accounts that pay 4.5 - 5 percent interest.  It&#039;s easy, I use gmacbank*** but there&#039;s others that pay a little more.  The interest is taxable of course, but would also be if it were in CD&#039;s.  Your prolly 2 young to mess with IRA or stocks or bonds or real estate. <br>

Good year to NOT be in the stock market.  Just stay liquid.  Very bad year for real estate !

</script><p> If you need it within three years, you shouldn&#039;t risk it in stocks or bonds, because you might wind up with much less than you invested. With such a short horizon, it would be best to put it into a money market or savings account. You won&#039;t make much money, but you won&#039;t probably lose any.
        </p> This inventory marketplace is particularly undesirable, yet distinctive clever investors sense that the ultimate time to discover good bargains/undervalued shares is while the marketplace outlook is particularly bleak. the different factor it is advisable to attempt is making an investment purely a element of money at a time (like 10% of the lump sum each and every 2 weeks) that way you could finally end up possessing greater shares. case in point, in case you purchase 10 shares at $10 and then the inventory drops to $5, you could then purchase 20 shares - voila!
        </p> Online saving acct.  Earn roughly 5% and accessible at any time without it being in the marlet or a CD.
        </p> Money market is the best way to practice it. Money will be born with good market strategies.
        </p> I&#039;ll probably take a saving account, isn&#039;t much to gain but there&#039;s no risks
