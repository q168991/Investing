</script><p> If you just park it in a savings account and they give you say five percent your loosing the cost of inflation plus five percent you could have if you just invested it in treasuries or right now index funds or a ira roth account. Do you have bonds are you divesified are you sprad over eight or more mutual funds indexs and do you have any CD&#039;S or lend you family money with low interest or specualte with small amounts until you double it then take the double say 1 k put the double 1 k in  <br>
a roth until you max ou then do the same with a regular ira <br>
if its not a write off then have it for the write off ive heard of borrowing on a credit card to fill up the rothira if your over fifty you could squrril away 6 thopusand a year and another 5 for <br>
your spouse unless she is over fifty too its six thou for each then. savd money gaining five percent actually looses the cost of inflation to where you could be loosing principle too. <br>
Try over nights loans to banks some do weekend account for minimum of 25 k and ou write a check to lend a bank 25 k for the weekend and you rotate it every weekend to another account they pay eight or 10 percent for this and yomake a extra interest compounded ov er the year fiftwo times a year <br>
thats how many week ends in a year four a month times twelve. right.every monday you transfer back the check to your other bank 25 k and bank off the interest do this every weekend <br>
you float yourself your money thru the bank for those extra days a year intrest so your money is gaining allday friday in the old bank while in the bank new account too and your money pays you those two days in transfer between banks <br>
they float a loan for the higher rate cash deposit on the books and they balance off the book before end og the month <br>
all legal and you gain a couple days interest in the exchane of the money keep it moving and more you do nore you make. <br>
also some months you going to take your money in cash hit a few garage sells and bu y out the whole thing for the lowest price and try to make upthe prices for all the gear selling it on ebay for fast cash to hike more cd&#039;s or ira roth money to max out your write off tax atvantages better to make your money earn your returns taxes mney back than just let uncle same collec the interest free loan you give him oweing taxes and not taking advantage of the write off to save you from having to pay taxes so you get a higher refund. use your taxes cause the gov is only wasting your money in a war no one approves of and dont want anyway.cheers
        </p> Save in a savings account; the bank will invest the money and give you a very small piece of their profit.   <br>
 <br>
Sell things that you make or something that you write.   <br>
 <br>
Sell a service.
        </p> Sure, it&#039;s called a J O B.  Get yourself one.  I highly recommend it.  Just ignore the scam artists and their spamvertized websites.  They&#039;re all ripoffs.
