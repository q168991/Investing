<h1>Which of these books about investing should I read?</h1>
<div class="answer">I have &amp;#39;Stock Investing for Dummies&amp;#39; and Benjamin Graham&amp;#39;s &amp;#39;The Intelligent Investor&amp;#39;. I told myself I would read the entirity of the dummies one before I read Graham&amp;#39;s famous book, but I&amp;#39;m halfway through it (finish the first two parts) and it&amp;#39;s starting to get boring, and technical. Should I force myself to read the whole thing, or just go ahead and read The Intelligent Investor?

Thanks for any advice :)<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> If you are bored after reading 2 sections of a book then I suggest that you give your money away now and take up knitting or something else far less risky.....you will save yourself a whole lot of time and grief. <br>
 <br>
Seriously, investing is tough and you should be prepared to work hard to learn, before you learn the hard way. <br>
 <br>
Try a hands on approach with virtual trading, as that will either put you off or encourage you to stick at it.....at least you can not lose any money virtual trading.

so far, you&#039;ve discovered that you regard technical details as boring.  well and good -- that pretty much rules out intermediate term trading as something you want to do. <br>
 <br>
Graham [or the newer, revised version] is mostly about the fundamental issues that long term investors pay critical attention to.  Maybe you&#039;ll find that boring and technical as well; maybe not. <br>
 <br>
If you don&#039;t, then long term investing is much more likely to be your mode of operation -- at least as far as stocks are concerned. <br>
 <br>
If you do find it boring and technical, then the next step is to look into visual chart reading -- which relates mostly to short term trading. <br>
 <br>
*** <br>
No matter what you discover about yourself, I strongly recommend finding some area of investing that you actually like, if not love totally.  Maybe that&#039;s rehabbing houses.  Maybe it&#039;s looking at land use patterns and undeveloped real estate.  Maybe its something else, too. <br>
 <br>
Every field of investing has its experts -- professionals who make money regularly.  Because they&#039;re highly interested, they&#039;ve invested countless hours learning everything they can -- and they use that learning to make their strong returns. <br>
 <br>
It follows that the likely path to strong investment returns is through strong learning and you&#039;ll only do the learning if you like or love the material. <br>
 <br>
*** <br>
And if you discover that you don&#039;t like or love investing at all -- well, maybe you&#039;re supposed to start your own business and run that instead.
        </p> You should read them both.   They are such a big contrast in how they are written.  Do you want to read a book written for Dummies or do you want to challenge yourself?   I think reading both will give you perspective on the vast ways to approach a similiar topic.    <br>
 <br>
I tried to read Graham&#039;s book and I thought it was hard and I am pretty scholarly otherwise.   Good Luck.
