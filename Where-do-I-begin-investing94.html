<h1>Where do I begin investing?</h1>
<div class="answer">I&amp;#39;m a college student looking to begin investing some money. I don&amp;#39;t have a whole lot of money to start with so a couple options I looked at were the stock market or even possibly the forex market. I really want to learn about investments so I would like to know of any sites/books that would help me learn how to begin. Does anyone know where I should look?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Congratulations on getting started. It’ll help you more than you know!  <br>
 <br>
I&#039;d avoid Forex until you know more about trading.  It&#039;s extremely easy to get in to, and extremely easy to lose it all if you don&#039;t know what you&#039;re doing.  So, stick with stocks to start.  After all, you&#039;re working to build for your future.  So start with a good foundation and build on it. <br>
 <br>
Your first dollars should be spent on getting educated on investing. You don&#039;t have to train to trade them professionally, but we are talking about your future here. So the more you learn, the more it&#039;ll help you!  So let&#039;s start there. <br>
 <br>
You ask a very broad question, so be prepared for a pretty long answer. Just take it in chunks! <br>
 <br>
 <br>
How to invest depends on what you already know. We&#039;ll assume that you&#039;re beginning! <br>
 <br>
A good primer is How to Make Money in Stocks by William O&#039;Neil. You can get it cheap just about anywhere. It’s widely available new or used. <br>
 <br>
Another good one is one of Jim Cramer&#039;s books like Real Money (he’s got a few) or  <br>
The Little Book That Makes You Rich: A Proven Market-Beating Formula for Growth Investing (Little Books. Big Profits) by Louis Navellier and Steve Forbes (Oct 5, 2007).  <br>
 <br>
But books will only get you so far. At some point, you&#039;ll also want to get at least a little training. There are some great education companies if you want to make the investment. Investools*** or optionetics*** are both very good companies as is tmitchell*** who teaches trading futures. <br>
 <br>
For free, you can start by visiting thestreet*** and investopedia***. That&#039;ll get you a pretty good primer so at least you&#039;ll understand what the markets are and what a stock is, etc.   <br>
 <br>
If you get a chance, watch Mad Money on CNBC. Don&#039;t trade any of his picks until you track many of them over time. Just use the show to get you to understand some basics and get a feel for the market itself.  He’s good at breaking down companies from a value perspectice. <br>
 <br>
Next, subscribe to something like Investorsbusiness daily or something like that that can help you identify good stocks.  You don’t need anything like the Wall St Journal, MSN Money, or some of those other sites.  IBD is just fine at picking great stocks if you are not good at doing that on your own. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Once you understand stocks, go to 888options***. It&#039;s a website that&#039;ll help you understand options (what they do, how they work, etc). You don&#039;t need to trade them, but the more you know, the more you&#039;ll see how options can really be the safest way to invest (once you&#039;re educated). <br>
 <br>
For discipline (which is crucial to successful trading), probably Trading in the Zone by Mark Douglas or Mastering the Trade by John Carter <br>
 <br>
I know that’s a LOT to absorb. Just take it one step at a time for now. Start with a book or two to give you an idea of where to begin. Take your time, and let it seep in.  <br>
 <br>
As you get up to speed, you should papertrade to practice (highly recommended). This should help reduce your losses in the beginning as you get used to buying/selling. <br>
 <br>
You can practice for free on almost any reputable broker site (optionsxpress, scottrade, thinkorswim, TD Ameritrade, etc). And yes, you can definitely deal easily online. <br>
 <br>
Start slow, then as you figure things out, you can buy more shares. <br>
 <br>
Congrats again on getting started. If you have any questions, please let me know.  <br>
 <br>
Hope this helps!

</script><p> I commend you for your interest to manage your finances even if you are still on college level.  I actually started a bit late, so I really do appreciate those young individuals who plan their future and are responsible for their finances  There are many websites, which you can use to learn more about investing.  I suggest you explore and read those sites first so you will learn a lot.  Read the business section of the newspaper so you would also know the market trends. If you also know a reliable financial guru or mentor, it will be better so they can guide you on the ins and out of the business.  <br>
 <br>
Stock market investing is better if you will do it on a long-term basis because you will earn more through compound interest.  Trading on the other hand, is very risky, and may cause you a lot of losses particularly if you are not an expert in timing the market.
        </p> Forex is a very bad idea.  There are people selling books and tools, but they&#039;re making their money off the books and tools, not forex trading. <br>
 <br>
You don&#039;t know enough about foreign exchange.  They&#039;ll sell you a brochure that makes it seem like you&#039;re in on the secret, but the reality is that foreign exchange is very volatile, and you could easily lose a lot of money. <br>
 <br>
Start with an investing for dummies book. <br>
 <br>
Basically, to get more return, you need to take on more risk.  If there were a high-return, low-risk investment, everyone would pile into it, driving up the price and lowering the return.
        </p> Forex is generally a bad idea.... but at the very least wait until you&#039;ve got at least five years of very successful stock trading under your belt (with superb skills in risk management). <br>
 <br>
As a general rule no web site is going to teach you much about &quot;investing&quot;.  Start with three basic books; <br>
Stock Investing For Dummies <br>
How To Make Money With Stocks - William O&#039;Neil <br>
Beating The Street - Peter Lynch
        </p> If your really interest in investing (not trading)  Read The Intelligent Investor and Security Analysis.  Both books are by Benjamin Graham.  Do not invest until you know the rules of game and learn the art of investment.
        </p> With stocks, you buy shares of a company&#039;s stock and sell them at a later time, at a higher price to make money. You could invest in many thing like precious metals, baseball cards, etc. An investment is putting money into something, and hoping it will appreciate in value
        </p> Your best best is some sort of mutual fund or collective instrument. This is the only way you will get diversity with limited funds. The other practical answer is, probably, don&#039;t! Concentrate on studies, qualifications and a job first.
        </p> Buy Apple right now, super cheap and way discounted.  Follow the business news and dable small amounts here and there.  You will learn.
