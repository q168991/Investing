<h1>How should I invest this 1K?</h1>
<div class="answer">Have $1000 to invest in, first time investor here. I know there are as many opinions on what to invest in as there are sand grains on a beach, so just give me you&amp;#39;re honest quick opinion of what you would do if you were in my place. This is what I&amp;#39;m considering:

AMZN - Amazon - 176.50   
IBM  - IBM - 165.94   
WDC  - Western Digital - 37.63    
RHT  - Red Hat - 44.71   
NTDOY- Nintendo - 30.30

I have $1000 to spend on these, what would you do? :)<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> spend it on your education.  this would be, by far, the best paying investment you could likely make. <br>

if you won&#039;t do that, then ...  RHT or IBM.  IBM finally broke upward out of a ten year long trading range in the past few months as their services volumes to corporations have increased significantly.  Fair dividend, too.  RHT is the leader in non-Microsoft operating systems for servers and pcs -- they&#039;re gaining market share. <br>
 <br>
NTDOY and WDC are in very intense competition with other major players -- margins will continue to be squeezed for the foreseeable future and they may yet prove to be the losers in their fields. <br>
 <br>
AMZN is so big that they, in essence, can&#039;t gain market share and are in competition with multiple other players [eBay, for certain].  Tough to see that they&#039;re going to do better than just average. <br>
 <br>
*** <br>
AND -- this may be the wrong time to buy anything.  Prices look high relative to earnings almost everywhere.  Sitting on your cash may well be the best decision for six to 24 months or even longer.

</script><p> I agree with No.1 comment.. Prices are really high these days..  <br>
However, aftersome time, you should consider: IBM, XOM, APPLE, CHEVRON, GS.. <br>
Varity of stocks is better, because at least you will minmize any risks.. <br>
 <br>
Good Luck
