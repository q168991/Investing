Start reading about stock market,companies, index and other news of financial world. Share market is extremely risky and if not handled your investment properly your whole capital can be wiped out.  <br>
If you are going for investment (not trading) then keep investing at regular intervale. Stay away from derivatives. You can talk to some brokers before going for it. There are many brokers with pan india presence like angel broking, sharekhan, indiainfoline, religare. Dont make any decision in haste. <br>

        </p> I think some mutual funds will let you invest with as little as 50$ / month (with automatic deposit) but may require you to put down several thousand dollars up front. As for which mutual fund, there are a bunch but a number of them (like Fidelity) have funds that automatically spread your investment into the right blend of investment categories based on when you want to retire which means you don&#039;t have to worry about how to invest your money ... Probably a good start for you until you can talk to more people and learn more about retirement investing.
        </p> When you think to start investment you should start as early as possible your decision is right but invest in share market not a single time invest regularly
        </p> If one starts early in investing in shares for long period, one gets accumulation wealth effect. It is nice that you wish to start so early in your life. <br>
 <br>
But I suggest, first learn about everything related to share markets and investments. Read, Discuss, ask questions  - get as much information as possible. Observe what other investors are doing and how. <br>
 <br>
Then and then only start investing.
        </p> Too early after starting earning you should start to invest in share market and mutual fund
        </p> yes but don&#039;t invest more than 200rs in a month and don&#039;t sell than quickly invest for long time like 3 to 4 years. <br>
mutual fund also good option for more info on mutual fund and trading visit
        </p> All time is right to invest in stock market if you have a long time to stay invested
        </p> first complete your studies. then think of something else. as for investing in share market  get detailed information about market. get acquainted with its nity kity, then do some dummy/ mock trade, after spending/ wasting 2/3 years, you may enter/exit the market.
        </p> Yes start early is always right in share market
        </p> You are advised not to poke your nose in the share market but in studies. Complete your studies and then come in share market.  <br>
 <br>
You may opt commerce for the same which will give much knowledge to you.

        </p> The sooner the better. However before you do that make sure you know what you are doing. Read a lot and do a lot simulation before join in real trade.
        </p> Why you are too hurry for investment enjoy your life and when you start to earn start your investment
        </p> If you want to take participation in share market, better you take advice of your father or any elder one whom is involved in it. you can also take help of GOOGLE to solve your problem. it would be helpful to you or you can also watch a video on youtube related to this, it will help you as you can see the whole procedure in spite of reading theoretically
