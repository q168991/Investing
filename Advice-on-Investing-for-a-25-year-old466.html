<h1>Advice on Investing for a 25 year old?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am a 25 yr old married man.  Total net income is approx. 80k/yr.  My wife has no 401(k)/IRA, but I do have a company matched which i max out and then add on 6% before tax unmatched after that, which totals 12% of my paycheck going into my 401(k).  We have our savings, approx 17k in a high interest online savings account.  We have a 529 being funded $100 every month for when my wife goes back to school.  We also have approx. 35k in mutual funds.  

Zero credit card/school loan debt and only a car payment on 1 of our 2 cars.  We do rent as of now, only because we are &amp;quot;on call&amp;quot; to be transfered out of town within 6 months.

Here is my question:  We will be coming into approx. 5k in the next month or so and I want some opinions on how to invest it.  Stick with mutual funds?  Are REITS even worth it with the housing market as it is?  I am pretty familiar with mutual funds, but after that, my knowledge is limited.

Any advice?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> From what I understand from what you have presented, I suggest that you establish a ROTH account for your wife.  Establish it in one of the mutual funds with which you are familiar.  I suggest you place the maximum contribution for 2007 and reserve the remainder for January for 2008. <br>
 <br>
Everything else looks really solid.  You didn&#039;t say anything about children, whether you have any now or plan to have in the future.  The 529 plan would work for them as well.  I would suggest you check out the website ***upromise***.  I always link a upromise account with every 529 account that I set up.  One thereby gets free education money for nothing. <br>
 <br>
I hope that this helps.

</script><p> Since your life is so busy, I would advise you to stay with a mutual fund. Further, look for a mutual fund that is not similar to what you currently own, so you will have some diversification. <br>
 <br>
In the meantime, try to give yourself a little knowledge about individual stocks and investing in individual shares. You sound young, so you need to gain some knowledge before you take too many risks.
        </p> The other answers about having a budget and emergency fund first are right on. Once those are set, you can move onto investing. Bottom line: don&#039;t invest in anything you don&#039;t understand! It&#039;s the fastest way to lose money. The first thing I recommend you study are index funds. The book Bogle on Mutual Funds by John C. Bogle (the founder of Vanguard family of funds) is a great start. Good luck!
        </p> I would have to agree with some of the other posters and suggest you probably stick with a mutual fund. You probably do not have much time to go hunting for stocks. <br>

        </p> Mutual fund is the safest &amp; easiest to invest
        </p> Check for the breakpoints schedule on your mutual funds , I advise my clients to stick to one fund  to qualify for lower commissions on shares and stick to A shares only!!!!
