</script><p> If your goal is for retirement, then you have decades to invest and can take a fair amount of risk. How much ultimately depends on how much you are willing to accept for volatility and the roller coaster rides that happen from time to time. <br>
 If you don&#039;t have a Roth IRA yet, by all means make one -- your money grows tax free, and you can later withdraw it tax free. <br>
 Consider choosing a few moderately aggressive index funds or ETFs like Emerging Markets, small-cap, mid-cap, and Energy funds, and add some balance with the S&amp;P500 or total stock market  <br>
fund. <br>
 Choose a company to invest through carefully. Some of the best are Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, and Schwab. Avoid the big banks like the plague. Don&#039;t let them rip you off with loads (sales charges) and fees. Check how much the company charges you as an expense ratio. A good one might charge you 0.2-0.8 %. If they charge more than 1% than go somewhere else. And if they charge any kind of 12b-1 fee, hold on to your wallet and RUN. <br>
 For more information, try looking at <br>

and play with it, comparing funds with more or less risk. <br>
 <br>
Do some reading online such as  <br>

and books like Investing for Dummies for a good intro.

</script><p> You should establish a &quot;rainy day fund&quot; for emergencies. <br>
 <br>
Once that is in place, then your choice of investment is going to depend on your horizon - how long it will be until you are going to need the money. <br>
 <br>
Since you&#039;re 27, your retirement funds can be pretty aggressive, if you can stand the potential volatility.  You&#039;ll typically want to diversify among stock from US, foreign and emerging markets.  You may also want to temper this with some bonds or balanced investments.  Within your stock investing, you can look at indexes, growth, value, etc. <br>
 <br>
For shorter horizons, five years or less, you don&#039;t want volatility, since the time when you need the money might end up being a &quot;sell low&quot; time, if the investment is volatile.  For these you&#039;re probably going to want to look at short-term bonds/bond funds, or even cash equivalents, such as money market instruments, CDs and the like.
        </p> If you&#039;re younger, now could be a well time to speculate available in the market with a inventory fund. The conventional mantra is purchase low promote prime and the marketplace is traditionally low proper now. Bonds are a first-class low hazard funding that can be utilized as a tax safe haven with regards to municple or so that you can lock in profits made within the inventory marketplace. Generally humans that put money into bonds are extra conservative traders or the ones which might be at or close a retirement age and do not desire to hazard the quick time period fluctuations of the inventory marketplace. If you&#039;re younger and feature decades till retirment move with the shares. If you&#039;re in a position to retire you would desire to remember the protection and tax advantages to precise bonds.
        </p> The guidelines are quite vague and unsubstantiated, the usual advice that you would get when you&#039;re young is to be aggressive and often the young will invest in a 100% growth or a 95% growth portfolio because of this.   However you will have your investments for a long time and hence it&#039;s almost assured that your portfolio will have to weather a downturn or two which typically happens at least once every decade.   When you have a 100% portfolio, there&#039;s nothing to be done during a downturn except hold on for the ride so there is no way for you to mitigate the downturn and benefit from the bargain prices that it presents.   For this reason, the likes of Ben Graham and Claude Shannon advocate a 50/50 portfolio. <br>
 <br>
The key behind a 50/50 portfolio is that 50% is kept relatively risk free in bonds and cash equivalents which means that when the market goes down, you can take advantage of the downturns by simply rebalancing back to the 50/50 position.   It acts like  a one way valve so that your fortunes gain with the market when it&#039;s going up and doesn&#039;t lose too much when the market is going down.   Shannon&#039;s infamous lecture on the 50/50 portfolio has been called &quot;Shannon&#039;s Demon&quot; in reference to the concept of &quot;Maxwell&#039;s Demon&quot; in thermodynamics because of the one way effect on entropy.   The 50/50 portfolio and rebalancing harvests volatility and the one thing you know when you&#039;re young is that you&#039;ll see both ups and downs in the market. <br>
 <br>
If you go with the usual advice of aggressive, the only thing you are assuring is that you will not be able to take advantage of the few spectacular sales that will come your way during your accumulation phase.   The gains from scooping up bargains during market downturns are literally once in a decade opportunities and you&#039;d be giving up on these extraordinary opportunities. <br>
 <br>
Another thing people will talk about is risk tolerance, as if the increase in reward for increased risk always justifies the risk so long as you can tolerate it, this is not the case.   There is a limit beyond which the additional risk is not worth the additional reward.   Imagine if you played Russian roulette with a thousand chamber gun, one bullet and spinning the chambers after each pull of the trigger, you&#039;ll still be dead after the first loss, the game may be worth pointing the gun at your leg but pointing it at your temple is assuming too much risk. <br>
 <br>
If you define your objective as comfort, then risk tolerance should be considered, if you define your objective as optimal growth of your portfolio then if you know the probabilities of the outcomes, you can actually calculate the optimal risk to assume.   The method was described by Daniel Bernoulli in his 1738 paper &quot;Exposition of a New Theory on The Measurement of Risk&quot; and was rediscovered by John L Kelly (Kelly Criterion) in 1956 when applying Claude Shannon&#039;s information theory to gambling and investing.   Kelly used gambling examples which simplified the derivation of a simple equation due to the binary nature of gambling wagers, the well defined probabilities and the well defined outcomes so at first glance the equation seems to only apply to sizing a bet for a binary wager but if you step back to the concept of optimizing the geometric mean outcome, you&#039;ll see that it applies to portfolio construction (concurrent Kelly) as well as multiple outcomes.   The interesting thing is that is you take 12% per year as a proxy for the usual expected return from investing in a company (economists use 12% as a proxy for stock market returns), 2% per year as the probability of total loss (based on the average Fortune 500 company having a life expectancy of 40 years) and 8% per year as the probability of a market downturn of about 60% loss then you would want to invest X percentage of your portfolio in stocks while keeping the rest risk free (cash, bonds or cash equivalents) such that you maximize the following geometric mean of outcomes: <br>
 <br>
e^( 0.9 * ln( 1 - X + X * 1.12 ) + 0.08 * ln( 1 - X + X * 0.4 ) + 0.02 * ln( 1 - X ) ) <br>
 <br>
which would be at a maximum of 1.01025 when X is 0.45 so given those assumptions about stock market returns which are reasonable assumptions, the optimal portfolio growth would be when 45% is invested in the stock and 55% kept as cash. <br>
 <br>
Obviously, better returns are possible, a probability distribution function should be used, the probability of a total loss can be addressed with diversification etc.  so it&#039;s quite possible for the optimal percentage to be higher.   The famous investor Ben Graham advises no more than 80% and no less than 25%, suggesting just shy of 50% to be the most prudent choice, you&#039;ll notice that as aggressive as Warren Buffett is, he&#039;s never fully invested. <br>
 <br>
You&#039;ll note that this mathematically and experience based estimates for optimal portfolio construction tends to correspond with the moderate choice not the aggressive growth choice.
        </p> You are young so go aggressive for about 20 years.  I recommend a small cap index fund because historically they have the highest returns with low transaction and expense fees.  The best thing to do is find a great mutual fund with a history of beating the market.  Use the Morningstar rankings to help make a choice.  The TCW Small Cap Growth Mutual Fund is one of the best.  If you are interested in emerging markets mutual fund there are two that average 20% annual returns.  Their tickers are DEMSX, WAGMX.
        </p> You are 27 and are earning 2.500 bucks a month.  You should be absolutely conservative to start with.   <br>
 <br>
You should put aside 20% every month, if you can manage that, into bonds which are guaranteed for principal and interet payments. <br>
 <br>
Once you are past 32, when your earnings increase with age and experience, you can slowly venture into mutual funds and shares. <br>
 <br>
66% of your savings should go to guaranteed income schemes.  20% into mutual funds and only the balance 16% should go to stocks and shares. <br>
 <br>
With experience, after some time, say 7 to 10 years, your risk taking abilities will change depending on your perception, experience and environmental changes in the money markets. <br>
 <br>
You can re work your strategy at that time.
        </p> At twenty-seven, I recommend aggressive.  Time is on your side.  The market just crashed because of Japan&#039;s tragedy.  People in their eighties heavily invested in stocks should be worried.  I&#039;m relatively young, the down turn is a buying opportunity for us young-ins&#039;. <br>
 <br>
It all comes down to your tolerance for risk, however. <br>

@Subasu: <br>
The question is about risk.  You&#039;re answering how much he can afford to invest.  Two totally different discussions.
