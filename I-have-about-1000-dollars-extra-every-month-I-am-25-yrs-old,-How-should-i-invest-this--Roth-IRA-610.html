</script><p> roth ira is a good idea, but you can only put a small amount per year.  if you can participate in a 401k, do that.  better yet, if your employer has a roth 401k, do that.  401k&#039;s have much higher annual limits than ira&#039;s.

</script><p> Roth IRA is a good start, how about your 401K or IRA?  Do you have stock purchase plan where you work?  Do you have a mortgage? if no, you may want look for a small property *which I think you&#039;re single @ 25*, this would be good since you are paying rent right?  sock away $200-300 into a savings account.
        </p> A Roth IRA is a good start. If you need help with this you can contact Primerica which is a financial firm and ask for Roy. he can help you with this. Call 630 368-1888 and tell him Pat told you to call. He can answer any questions you have about investing.
        </p> at this age, you should be 100% in stocks/equities.  There a $4000 limit on how much you can put into a Roth each year. <br>
 <br>
However, you can open a mutual fund account to make monthly deposits.  I would recommend a fund that mimics the SP500.   <br>
 <br>
I also like:  Vanguard Equity Income Fund (VEIPX).  That is were I have some of my money.
        </p> Hi Jaden, <br>
 <br>
I suggest you to start your own forex/cfd trading. You should invest some amount for the education or you could educate yourself from the books.  <br>
 <br>
If you don&#039;t want to trade yourself then you may find trader who accepts private investments. <br>
 <br>
I&#039;m forex trader and accept private investments. I pay to my investors at least 5% monthly for 12 moths. Minimum investment amount is US$2000. If you decide to join me then PM or e-mail (press on my name) and I provide you with further investment details.  <br>
As you probably know December is very volatile in currency trading and it could be extremely profitable to start investment now.  <br>
Furthermore you could create very profitable investment strategy by investing every month. <br>
 <br>
Hope for long and successful collaboration
        </p> Invest in the Forex, but manage your own money. I use a platform which brings in about 34% ROI on a monthly basis. ***simple4xinvesting*** <br>

        </p> if you have that much extra, put about 1/2 to 2/3rds in bonds or a mutual fund, and the other half into some nice blue-chip stocks like big oil companies, microsoft, boeing, or other stocks that aren&#039;t too volatile.  then jus let your money grow.  if you wanna take on some risk, go to a brokerage and talk to them about what to buy
        </p> I have several friends who have opened up ROTH accounts and they reccomend that option. Our generation has to have something to retire with. especially since we&#039;re expected to retire at age 70....
