</script><p> On-line investing/trading can be very rewarding as long as you just don&#039;t open an account to see how you&#039;ll do.  Most people just &quot;give it a try&quot;.... what you really need to do is learn first.... ignorance in this game can be very expensive. <br>
 <br>
#1:  Learn the basics.  Read a few books on the area you&#039;re interested in. <br>
      Start with: Stock Investing For Dummies <br>
#2:  Don&#039;t try penny stocks until you&#039;ve been investing successfully for 3-5 years (if at all). <br>
       Most traders won&#039;t go near penny stocks because the risk is ridiculous. <br>
#3:   Job number one is risk management. The goal  #1 to lose less money (contrary to trying to make a lot of money)... if you manage your risk... the winners will take you the rest of the way.... However... if you&#039;re losing stocks are more $$$ than the winning stocks.... you&#039;re out of business. <br>
#4:   Good traders can be &quot;right&quot; only 40% of the time. It&#039;s the risk/reward ratio that makes the difference. <br>
#5:   Never (ever) take stock tips (from the web, TV, Radio, friends, strangers, &quot;experts&quot;). <br>
 <br>
The market is not a &quot;big gamble&quot;. When you lose a lot of money...  it&#039;s totally your fault... not the &quot;market&quot;.  If you can&#039;t accept that..... don&#039;t bother investing or trading.   You control your position size.... you control your protective stops.  Learn this stuff &amp; you&#039;ll do well. <br>
 <br>
PS:  Never use the following words when it comes to your trading; <br>
Hope, wish, believe, expect &amp; the worst phrase is; <br>
&quot;It can&#039;t go any lower&quot;.....................................

</script><p> My answer is different than the others.  1. TDAmeritrade, etrade, scottrade, they are all good, all have great software, but TDAmeritrade offers think or swim, and has free tuturials.  If you know the market is a gamble, you can reduce your odds by developing a trading strategy.  You will have to read a book.  It sounds like you want to trade rather than invest.  2.  An online broker is the only way to go.  Full service brokers are idiots, and will not do you do service.  It is fun! Even when you get good, figure on winning 6 - 7 times out of ten.  You will limit your losses to 2 - 5% but your upside gains can be unlimited, but more than likely 7 - 15% or short term trades.  3. Regardless of what you invest in, never put all your eggs in one basket.   <br>
My suggestion for reading &quot;Wallstreet Money Machine&quot; by Wade Cooke.  All you need to do is read one chapter.   Rolling Stocks.  You can buy it on Amazon for a couple of dollars used.
        </p> &quot;i am thinking about doing some&quot; ... the pros who eat, breathe, and live stock market are happily awaiting your coming.  They have lots of financial backing, years or decades of experience, professional business plans, excellent risk and money management skills, and a lot of knowledge of their own weaknesses. <br>
 <br>
when you have these same things, you&#039;ll be able to compete with them on an even basis.  until you do, the odds are stacked against you -- i&#039;d guess them at 49 to 1 against or worse. <br>
 <br>
still -- it&#039;s your money. <br>
 <br>
how much did you propose to lose in order to find out if you&#039;re any good yet?
        </p> Investing and stock trading are entirely different. They are no where near the same.
        </p> well, since I invest to make money, I go with Scottrade due to their lower commissions.
