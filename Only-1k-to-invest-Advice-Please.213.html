<h1>Only 1k to invest Advice Please.?</h1>
<div class="answer">Hi. Ok I know, well as the heading states,  I have 1k floating around so i can either spend it save it or indeed invest it, that&amp;#39;s the question. I would like to have a go at the stock market  say fst dow jones etc,
but in all honesty hve not got a clue???. What advice would You or could You give, obviously if Someone here has some type of experience with this then please can You shed a little light my way.
How would i learn about the stock market ? 
Would there be some type of rookie/newbee guide on the net, (ive looked already but have not got a clue what to lookout for).
Or, if not the stock market is there somthing else You may suggest, Im from the Uk, just for reference. Thanks in advance Everyone.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> The best answer I can give you is to not put your money in the market just yet.  That is great that you want to get involved, however, you need to know that walking into the market with 1000.00 in your hand and no knowledge, would be like jumping into a school of parannah&#039;s.  Seriously, you should take your money and go buy some books to get schooled up first.   There are two distinctly different trading styles, one is called Technical Trading, and the other is called Fundamental trading.  Fundamental trading involves all that hard stuff like anaylzing a business&#039;s income statement and balance sheets etc to get a feel for its worth.   Then after YOU decide how much you think the company is worth, you check the actual market price.  If its trading below what you calculated it &quot;should&quot; be worth, then you might be inclined to buy it in hopes its trade price will one day rise upto its calculated value.  But, lemme ask you something... do you know how to accurately assign a value to a multimillion dollar company based on its Balance Sheet, Income Statement, Cash Flow and Earnings Forecast?  Hell no.  Neither do I. :)  Some people do, they are Warren Buffet, Peter Lynch, etc.   This type of investing is slow as molasas.  If you had 1000 dollors to invest, it would take you a whole lifetime to turn it into anything decent buying stuff like the dow jones index.  That thing goes up about 10% per year.  Think about it... if you put in 1000 dollors for a whole year, you would make 100 bucks (About).  Then your trading fee&#039;s, 10 to get in, 10 to get out, now you have only made 80 bux. That is a complete waste of your time.  Filthy rich people put zillions of dollars in the dow jones and 10 percent on that is ALOT.  but not for only 1k.   <br>
The OTHER kind of Trading is called Technical Trading.  With this method you dont even look at all that mind numbing data.  you look at the price trends.  What is something worth?  As much as someone is willing to pay for it. You understand that right?  So, there are some things about the price action on a daily/weekly/monthly basis that give up clues as to how everyone is feeling about the stock.  Get you a nice book on technical trading, I like the one called &quot;Technical Analysis Plain and Simple&quot;.  Dont cry when you see the 40 dollar price tag, consider that your first investment.   Then read up.  Next, open an Etrade account.  Fund it with your money.  Then start applying what you learned in the book to the real world.   <br>
  I would also suggest you have a look at the &quot;Penny Stock&quot; market.  These stocks move around very quickly.  Its like a time warp and a whole year of price action can take place in a week with these little guys.  The big market MIGHT let you eek out 80 bux in a year with 1k.  In the penny stock market, I could turn that 1k into 5k on a good week!   Thats where you need to begin with small money.  <br>
 <br>
  Know this... its brutal.  Its like learning to ride a bike. You can read all about it, but when it comes time to actually trade, your going to wreck.  and when you get up, your gonna wreck again. and again. Finally you will get the hang of it.... but only if you persist.   If you give up after the first crash or two, you will never learn to ride that bike and you will walk away and tell your friends and family about the time you invested in the stock market and lost all your money, and how they should never try either. . Once you learn to ride the bike, then you can start to work on tricks like riding with no hands, or popping wheelies!    Same thing here.  they say the vast majority of people trying to do this on thier own dont last more than 6 months.  they start to break even after than, and dont become profitable until 18months.  It all depends on how hard headed you are and how much you are willing to study to learn the ropes.  If you think you can gut trade and wing it, your going to crash and burn. If you instead put in the effort, and try hard and keep getting up, you can make it. once you get the hang of it, it is life changing.  Good luck sir.

        </p> You see penny stocks are high velocity, fast move, fast paced investments that you don’t typically hang onto for a long period of time. Understand how simple it is to make money with penny stocks https://tr.im/9EV1q <br>
 <br>
There are exceptions of course. Sometimes you will find some long-term trades that pay off big! Other times you will get into what are known as swing trades and those can really pay off as well. Most of the time though, profitable penny stock trading is all about the short game.  <br>
 <br>
In most cases you will buy and sell the same stock within a week. I’m not talking about day-trading which you may have heard about before. That’s a completely different game with a different set of rules. (It’s also a bit more risky.)
        </p> Binary options let users trade in currency pairs and stocks for various predetermined time-periods, minimal of which is 30 seconds. Executing trades is straightforward. The system uses user-friendly interfaces, which even an 8 years old kid, can operate without having to read any instructions. But winning trades is Not easy.  <br>
Binary trading is advertised as the only genuine system that lets users earn preposterous amounts of money in ridiculously short period of time. Advertisers try to implicate as if you can make $350 every 60 seconds; if it was true then binary trading would truly be an astonishing business.  <br>
However, does it make any sense? Can every trader make tons of money in binary trading? Who is actually paying all the money or the profit to traders?  <br>
The first challenge is finding a trustworthy binary broker; secondly, you need to find a binary trading strategy, which you can use to make profits consistently. Without an effective trading strategy, there is no way you can make money in this business. <br>
Learning a profitable trading strategy is possible, You should watch this presentation video https://tr.im/d0306 <br>
It&#039;s probably the best way to learn how to win with binary option
        </p> If you want to invest in stocks I would suggest more than $1000. I started investing with about that but with commissions at about $10 for the buy and $10 for the sell that is instantly down 2%. If invested well though you could make much more. I ussually limit my buys to nothing under $2000. The best advice I could give is to read and form your own opinions on investing because different stradegies work better for different people. Anything on value investing is ussually a good read. When picking a stock you want a stock that is selling for less than what it is worth with good growth potential. Once you form an opinion of a stock and believe its worth your money, buy it and do not even think about touching the sell button when it goes down. An example of this is me when I bought 660 shares of BAC at 5.97. It dropped to 4.90 and I refused to sell... I just sold it a week ago for 8.03... A nice profit of 34%. Hope this helps you out some.
        </p> You could just buy some silver coins or palladium when low priced. With 1k the stock market is not that good for you.  You could get 50, $20 shares of a stock. The risk is too high because you can lose as much as you could win. The stock market is not worth it if it&#039;s a one time 1k investment.
        </p> Penny stocks are loosely categorized companies with share prices of below $5 and with market caps of under $200 million. They are sometimes referred to as &quot;the slot machines of the equity market&quot; because of the money involved. There may be a good place for penny stocks in the portfolio of an experienced, advanced investor, however, if you follow this guide you will learn the most efficient strategies https://tr.im/ed075

to play with. you buy and sell  shares using the actual stock market prices, its just like the real thing you pay buying and selling  fees, and stamp duty( government tax) and you try and increase your virtual wealth. I started about six months ago  I have made some money on some shares but over all I&#039;m down -£13,511.28. Its an easy way to learn without risk
