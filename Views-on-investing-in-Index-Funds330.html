</script><p> You may want to consider the advice of John Bogle, the founder of the Vanguard Group of mutual funds and a very early proponent of index funds such as the S&amp;P 500 index (but not the first).  In his latest interview at ***wealthtrack***, he recommended taking your age and subtract from 100 to arrive at the amount to be allocated to the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund, with the remainder in the Total Bond Market Index Fund.   <br>
 <br>
As regards the Fidelity funds, to be fair to the manager, his or her performance should be compared to the custom benchmark (which may be a combination of indexes) for the type or style that he or she is using to manage the portfolio and not the Dow Jones which is only 30 stocks.  This benchmark should be stated in the prospectus for the fund that you are using.   <br>
 <br>
Also note that by using low cost index funds, you may be able to save as much as a $1,000 a year in fees between the Fidelity cost structure and the Vanguard index funds.  You should check the prospectus for each investment to confirm how much you are paying.   <br>
 <br>
For index funds, the lowest fees are the key, so research is simplified.  Be careful, some mutual funds offer temporary waivers of fees to make themselves attractive for the moment, and later increase them.  Vanguard, since it is ultimately owned by the investors in the funds, only lower the fees with profits from their operations.  So you as an owner benefits from Vanguard being more efficient.

Besides you didn&#039;t give your age, time horizon &amp; risk tolerance. Advisers are expensive. 1% a year is very high.... or 5.75% a Mutual Fund is also high (not as bad). <br>
 <br>
Assuming very little... total &quot;average 35 year old&quot;.   I&#039;d use a combination of ETF&#039;s and Mutual Funds; <br>
70% VTI (vanguard Total US Market ETF). <br>
20% DODFX (Dodge &amp; Cox International - Mutual Fund) <br>
5% IEMG (Emerging Market Fund ETF) <br>
5% BOND (Pimco Bond Fund, ETF) <br>
 <br>
I really think Bonds should be avoided by investors under age 60.... And very little now.  I put in a small amount... just for the heck of it.
        </p> Index funds are non-managed, low-cost, well diversified funds.  I am with Vanguard and have their Vanguard 2050 fund in ROTH IRA and Lifestyle Growth fund in individual account.  I would look into Vanguard*** and they have a wide verity of low-cost index funds and managed funds.
