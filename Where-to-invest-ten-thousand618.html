</script><p> Stay away from gold it is a bubble.  I would suggest a bank index or a homebuilder etf.  Both of those are trading at historical lows and will probably double n the next couple of years.  If you are looking for a long term investment I suggest a capital allocation fund by Osterweiss or Fairholme.  These funds switch to bonds the longer a bull market goes on to protect you from a crash.  The tickers for those mutual funds are faafx, fairx, or ostvx.  The two best international mutual funds I know of are demsx, or wagmx.  Both have a history of growing at 20% a year.  The best small cap growth mutual fund I know of is tgscx.
        </p> Put an amount, in percentage, equal to your age, into Vanguard Corporate bond fund. <br>
The balance into Vanguard Mid Cap Index. <br>
 <br>
I feel total stock mkt index would deliver bland results.
