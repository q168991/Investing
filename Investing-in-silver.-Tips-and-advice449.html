<h1>Investing in silver. Tips and advice?</h1>
<div class="answer">Hi, i&amp;#39;m 17 years old and i want to get into buying silver. I have done a lot of research and am fully convinced that its what i want to do. Id rather put my money into my future rather than clothes or electronics. I don&amp;#39;t have much money right now so gold is out of the question. I have enough money right now for about 3 or 4 ounces. Im thinking of starting out with American Silver Eagles or Canadian Silver Maples. Any tips on where to buy from? Gainsville coins seems like they have a good deal on 1 oz coins. Apmex is slightly more expensive but that can add up. Also, any tips on books or websites where i can learn more? Thanks in advance!<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> For that small amount, you would be better off going to a local coin shop.  Certain online dealers charge a premium for smaller orders, and you have to pay shipping.  I would go to sites like bulliondirect***, or kitco***, or libertycpm***, add to your cart what you want and get an estimate for the price of the metal + handling + shipping.  Then go to a local coin shop and get a quote from them for something similar.  Liberty Coin and Precious Metals (libertycpm***) is in the San Diego area.  Last I checked, their prices were cheaper than both bulliondirect*** and kitco***.  And if you are local, you can buy directly from their store. <br>
 <br>
You could also try craigslist, but you have to weed through the scams.  But you can negotiate wth people trying to sell their silver and possibly get a better deal than you would through a dealer. <br>

</script><p> You&#039;re right about investing instead of clothes and electronics but you&#039;re wrong about gold and silver being viable investments.    <br>
 <br>
Yes the price of gold has risen to a value of $1,652 today and this rise has been recent but if you look back 30 years, you would&#039;ve bought it at $850 per ounce in the 80&#039;s giving you a gain of 2.24% per year.   Even if you had bought it at $300 after the collapse in the 80&#039;s, you would&#039;ve made 5.85% per year all while the stock market was making 18% to 22% and inflation was 4.5%.   And of course silver has reportedly been lagging gold but I have no estimates of what it might&#039;ve been 30 years ago. <br>
 <br>
Then there&#039;s the spread.   With Gold it&#039;s typically 40%, indeed one dealer is offering 10 Oz of gold for $24,570 which works out to $2,470 an ounce, a 49.5% spread.   With Silver, a dealer is offering an ounce for $59.99 when the spot rate is $35.315 which is a 69.9% spread.   You pay this spread both ways when you buy and sell from and to a dealer so you&#039;re typically losing as much as 75% of your value investing in the above Gold and 91% of your value with the above silver, all without the prices changing at all.   It&#039;s certainly not a good investment to lose 91% of your value immediately before the rates even changes.   Gainsville does seem to have silver at the spot rate or lower but many of their items are not available, how likely is it that you&#039;ll get what you want and how verifiable is the bullion?   Most dealers charge a spread because they can, if someone is quoting the spot rate or lower on the bullion as Gainsville is, you need to find out why.   I don&#039;t know enough about Gainsville  to tell why they are below spot. <br>
 <br>
Without the spread, metals a poor investment, with a spread even a small one, it&#039;s a money loser.   You&#039;re better off with a even a secure 25% equity, 75% safer mutual fund which is safer then a 100% bond fund then you are investing in metals.   If you&#039;re cautious, a 50/50 fund should have the same risk as a 100% bond fund, if you&#039;re brave a 80% equity fund should be the limit, a 100% equity fund can not benefit from the bargains of a downturn.   You can have a gold or silver ETF as a small portion of your portfolio to diversify against systematic risk but that&#039;s like building a shelter against a comet hitting the Earth, it won&#039;t do much to help you.
        </p> Five easy ways to start collecting physical silver <br>
 <br>
1. Morgan Silver Dollars <br>
 <br>
The Morgan Silver Dollars are by far the most widely collected United States Coin. The dollars which are 90% silver and contain nearly an ounce of the precious metal were struck from1878 to 1904 and then in 1921, were produced in the hundreds of millions far more than ever needed for the time period.  <br>
 <br>
2. American Silver Eagle  <br>
The American Silver Eagles have been the official Silver coin of the United States since 1986. The demand for these coins has increased significantly in the last few years. These 1 ounce .9993 Silver coins not only hold silver value but a collector value as well. <br>
 <br>
3. Junk Silver <br>
Junk silver refers to coins with 90% silver and 10% copper content. Because junk silver coins have value as bullion, legal tender, and at times as collectibles, pre-1965 silver coinage really is an excellent value for anybody wanting to keep some silver stocked away. <br>
 <br>
4. Silver Art Bars <br>
 <br>
Silver Art Bars are usually .999 pure silver bars sold in 1 thru 100oz increments the minimum value of the silver art bar is its raw silver value (the current melt price). The Silver Art Bars also carry additional value depending on the rarity of the silver art bar and its popularity within the collecting community.  <br>
 <br>
5. Silver Rounds <br>
 <br>
Silver round are coin-shaped .999 pure silver bullion made by private mints not backed by any government for the purpose of silver collecting and investment. They are basically the same as the silver art bars as far as having both silver and collection value.
        </p> If you&#039;re convinced that buying silver is the right thing to do, I suggest three things. <br>
 <br>
First, be very good at doing math. You&#039;ll need it to be able to accurately calculate the amount of silver in a purchase. <br>
 <br>
Second, learn the specifications for US silver coins made before 1965, half dollars made from 1965-1970, and nickels made 1942 - 1945 (with the exception of those with the D mint mark, which are regular composition). <br>
 <br>
Third, start buying these coins.  You will pay much lower premiums for the silver than you will buying Eagles, Maple Leafs and other one ounce bullion. <br>
 <br>
Once you become more knowledgeable about calculating the silver value using the specifications and the current &#039;spot&#039; price, you can expand into two other areas. Foreign silver coins, and collectable silver such as Franklin Mint and other private mints. Do your research to know what&#039;s in them, and you can buy silver for much closer to spot than bullion coins, sometimes even below spot. <br>
 <br>
As for where to buy, avoid companies in the business of selling precious metals to avoid the highest premiums. Search eBay, and scour the local estate sales.  I&#039;ve found some of my best deals at estate sales with private mint stuff, when I knew exactly what I was looking at and my competition didn&#039;t.
        </p> I use APMEX to buy precious metals. They do not require a minimum purchase and they usually have American Eagles and Canadian Maples on hand. Some other sites will have your items on backorder for over 3 months because they do not have the silver on hand.  <br>
 <br>
Gold and silver are good investments to make but don&#039;t expect to make much money on them right away. They are a safe investment and will always have the same value in terms of buying power regardless of factors that effect the value of the dollar such as inflation. These metals are used more as a safeguard against economic crisis.  <br>
 <br>
It seems like you know what you are doing. If you are going to buy do it as soon as you can. The price will only go up over time.
        </p> Tip #1: Buy bullion bars and rounds, not numismatic coins at a premium. Stick to melt-down value and you won&#039;t ever need an appraiser and you always know their worth, and so does everyone else with an internet connection, so they&#039;re tradeable, and can be used as money in an emergency.  <br>
 <br>
Tip #2: Use Apmex and get it delivered to your front door. <br>

 <br>
Tip #3: Buy several one ounce bars to spread around; you&#039;ll find all kinds of uses. Leave one on your desk as a paperweight -- see who you can trust. <br>
 <br>
Tip #4: Carry a few with you on trips; throw a couple under the floor mat.  <br>
 <br>
Tip #5: Give them away as Christmas presents. Shopping done. Excellent value and oh, so pretty. <br>

        </p> It&#039;s hard to see how you are gonna make too much money, given the mark-up on each coin.  You&#039;re probably better off saving up &amp; buying a 10 oz. bar.  The problem with the physical coins (or even bars), is you buy at a premium &amp; you sell at a discount.   <br>
 <br>
And I say this as someone who has 50+ Morgan silver dollars.  But I collect these.  I don&#039;t see them as a great investment for my future.  For investments, I have stocks, &amp; mutual funds.
        </p> Buying coins &amp; bullion is surly a great way to make others rich..... just not you.    The largest single holder of silver (other than a government) is the ETF &quot;SLV&quot;.  No shipping or storage costs &amp; no heavy commissions......  you can buy from $1 worth to roughly $200,000 for the same cost in commisson (between $5 - $10).  The ETF &quot;SLV&quot; is backed by the metal itself.  This is not a &quot;paper&quot; investment. <br>
 <br>
Web sites like APMEX &amp; Gainsville are total rip off&#039;s.  They appeal to the novce or less knowledgable investor. <br>
 <br>
One other thought:   Don&#039;t put all your eggs in one basket.  Learn about the &quot;Tulip Mania&quot;.
        </p> First find a reputable coin shop nearby; they usually deal in bullion.I think you find they are the cheapest, given you don&#039;t have to pay shipping.
        </p> I suggest you to start investing on financial education. Start for an easy one: Rich Dad Poor Dad - R. Kiyosaki.
