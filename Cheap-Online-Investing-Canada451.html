<h1>Cheap Online Investing Canada?</h1>
<div class="answer">So Ive been looking to invest a small sum of money recently, in the range of 75-100 dollars. I don&amp;#39;t expect to make money but at the same time I don&amp;#39;t want to pay a 28$ commission on maybe 5 10$ stocks. Could someone list online investing/brokerage services that are cheap? Thanks!<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

Of course, it’s easier said than done. The natural thing to want when you see an increase in stock price is to hold the stock and hope for an even larger increase.
