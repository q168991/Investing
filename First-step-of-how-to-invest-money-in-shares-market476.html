</script><p> First you go ahead and open an account at one of Online Brokers(TDAmeritade, Schwab, ETrade,etc) <br>
 <br>
Then you fund the account with some money.  Don&#039;t invest any money you may need in the near future. <br>
 <br>
You do some research on which stocks to buy, read investing articles or get some guidance from an advisor working for online broker.. You can also watch the talking heads at CNBC for starters.  Also, http://finance.yahoo***  is a very useful website to research individual stocks and other equities. <br>
 <br>
After you do your homework and have some insight into which stocks might have upside potential, you start buying and selling stocks

</script><p> If you want to invest in shares market you need to have 3 things <br>
 <br>
(1) Spare Money - That even if you loose this it will not hurt. <br>
(2) Demat a/c - In this account you can &#039;store&#039; you shares (no papers) <br>
(3) Trading a/c - You can &#039;buy &amp; sell&#039; shares by this account <br>
 <br>
To open a demat a/c - Ask your bank (where you maintain a savings a/c) for opening a demat account. These days nearly all banks provide this facility. They will charge a very nominal amount from you for this service. <br>
 <br>
To open a trading account - Approach a online share-market broker or else, safest and reliable will be your bank. Some banks has their own trading accounts or they have a collaboration with some online brokers. Approach your bank and ask for details.  <br>
 <br>
The bottom line is &quot;Your Bank&quot; is the best choice. They can be your best guide &amp; support. Give a call to your bank (or visit), tell them that you need to open a demat &amp; trading account and the rest will follow.

i want to invest money in shares market but i have no idea
        </p> Develop an Understanding of the Power of Small Amounts <br>
The biggest mistake most people make is that they think they have to start with an entire Napoleon-like army. They suffer from the &quot;not enough&quot; mentality; namely that if they aren&#039;t making $1,000 or $5,000 investments at a time, they will never become rich. What these people don&#039;t realize is that entire armies are built one soldier at a time; so too is their financial arsenal.
        </p> first you have pan card then open d mat account with brokers and then study the movement of shares at least for one month if you go for stocks you must be prepared even the the loss of entire amount then it is not advisable for long term . the purpose of long term initially was to get good dividends but nowadays the facevalue is too low than the market value and the dividends when compared to markt values are paltry you go for purchase and sales within a week/fortnight for some simple profit intraday trading is ideal for earning but some what risky 5000/- will be insufficient for trading in stocks
        </p> An appropriate and prudent first step would be to read a good book on investment analysis and portfolio management. You may consider reading &quot;Investing Made Simple&quot; by Anthony Loviscek as an introduction. <br>
 <br>
You may also do a search at ***amazon*** or at your preferred search engine to find a further selection of suitable books. <br>
