</script><p> HDFC has a pretty good track record.  A sound holding, but I notice it is also the one in which you are investing the least.   <br>
 <br>
DSP also.  I am not certain though that it is such a good idea to invest that large a percentage into smaller companies though.  That might bight you in a market downturn like in 2008 when it lost 58% of its value.  HDFC lost only 49% but then one might argue there is nothing only about 49%.  <br>
 <br>
Reliance sort of falls somewhere between.  <br>
 <br>
Are you putting money away in a saving account too?  If not you might consider diverting just a tad to something a little less risky just to make sure you have something on hand when better opportunities present themselves such as during 2008 for example.  <br>
 <br>
Good mutual funds are met to be invested in for years not months.  Think 10 years for example.  At a very minimum 5 years unless all of a sudden one or more deviates from its norm.  If that happens bail out.

</script><p> HDFC  EQUITY fund is a multicap fund with a 5 star rating by value research. <br>
 <br>
DSP BR small &amp; midcap fund is also 5 star rated <br>
 <br>
Reliance Equity Opportunities is a midcap fund  <br>
 <br>
Ideally your core investment should be in large cap. <br>
 <br>
So invest Rs 3000 SIP in HDFC EQUITY and Rs 1000  in each of the other two. <br>
 <br>
Visit ***valueresearchonline*** to understand mutual funds.  <br>
 <br>
Invest via SIP for 1 year. Review the performance &amp; rating before renewing again .
        </p> You should invest in a mutual fund company, individual stocks are to risky. That said I would do some research then invest in a mutual fund company. I like Vanguard personally but there are a few other good ones out there. Invest in low expense ratio funds only. Do not pay more than .75% ER on a no load fund. Do not use a broker like the poster who suggested ING. The fees and the fees going forward will eat into your returns. Your young so you may be able to take more risk then someone older. A 3.75% account will not even keep you ahead of inflation. Don&#039;t go that route.
        </p> Hi Prasad  <br>
 <br>
Your portfolio looks good but as you have asked how many months or years to continue raises serious concerns. <br>
 <br>
SIP should be attached with the goals rather than saying you will invest for 5 or 10 years. <br>
