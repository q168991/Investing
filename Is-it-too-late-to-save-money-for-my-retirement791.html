<h1>Is it too late to save money for my retirement?</h1>
<div class="answer">Im 40 years old and I dont have any savings for my retirement, but working on starting one pretty soon and do not know where to go. I know depending on social security at the age of 65 will not be enough to feed us due to the inflation?

</script><p> You still have 25 years.  That is not too short a time, but you are going to have to work at it.   <br>
 <br>
Here are some possible scenarios.  They may not occur but also they might not be optimistic enough. <br>
 <br>
$5000 invested annually that were to earn 8% return annually would provide you with $365,000 at age 65.  <br>
 <br>
At 8% return that amount would provide you with a withdrawal amount of about $34,000 a year until your are 85.

</script><p> It is not too late, but plan on working until at least normal retirement age (probably 68 by the time you are that age).   <br>
 <br>
Start by checking with your employer&#039;s HR department about whether they offer a 401(k) and what the match is, if any.  This is free money you are bypassing.  Plan on depositing at least the amount necessary to get the max match (usually 6% of pay).  If possible, deposit more.  If you can&#039;t deposit the match-max, start by depositing as much as you can.  Then, each year when you get raises, deposit an extra 1% into the 401(k) - for example, if you got a 3% raise, you would add 1% to your deposit and still see a raise. <br>
 <br>
Read all the literature you can get from your employer - do not put your money into a conservative investment, as the yield will probably not allow for the amount of appreciation you need.  However, do not go overly risky with your investment, either - a decent mix of stocks and bonds, and a touch of cash should do, with a good mix of various mutual funds (growth, income, large cap, medium cap, international.).  As you get older and move closer to retirement, gradually move some of teh more aggressive investments toward the conservative side.  BTW, there are also funds that do this for you automatically - called lifestyle funds.  If you 401(k) offers these, you drop the money into them and nowhere else (these funds are already diversified based upon age and projected retirement and other investments can counteract the goals of the lifestyle fund). <br>
 <br>
If your employer does not offer a 401(k), you will be forced to rely on outside retirement funds, like an IRA.  Talk to a good fee-based investment counselor.  This will cost you some dollars for the consult, but fee-based is better than commission based since they tend to be more unbiased in suggesting investments (as you can imagine, a commission-based counselor will lean towards those investments that pay the highest commission, regardless of whether they are right for you). <br>
 <br>
Obviously, the message here is save as much as you can and invest it properly with an eye towards growth early and then safety as you get closer to retirement.
        </p> It&#039;s never too late to start saving for retirement, but the sooner you start the better! Check out this calculator for projecting retirement savings based on when you start. I highly recommend reading Total Money Makeover by Dave Ramsey! It really will completely change everything you think about money. I read it 6 months ago and found a way to pay off $43,000, now boosting money for retirement and the kids college funds, and paying off the mortgage is next! I only wish I had known about it back in my 20&#039;s! I am 34 now and looking great for retirement. Good luck!
        </p> It&#039;s never too late, but you better get going.  One option you can choose is to work longer than otherwise so that you get more from social security.  You don&#039;t have to retire at 65, and you can choose to not start drawing money from there at that age.  If you wait until 70, you&#039;ll get more per month than if you start at 65.  See your local office for details. <br>
 <br>
In the meantime, educate yourself on where and how to invest.  To start out with, find out if your employer has a 401K with a matching option.  If so, get moving, and fund that at least up to the point where they will not match any more money.  Then I&#039;d open an IRA - preferably a ROTH - and start putting all you can there.  I would go with an index fund with a very low expense ratio from one of the major investment funds, like TIAA-CREF, Fidelity, Vanguard, etc.  Talk to 2-3 of them and see what they recommend, and what you feel comfortable with.
        </p> No, it&#039;s not too late. You&#039;re going to want to try to make up for starting later than usual by adding more to your retirement than say, a 20 year old. But something is better than nothing. Depending on your income, you should start a IRA or Roth IRA. A Roth IRA is probably the better choice for most. Look up the differences online if you have questions. If you work for an employer that offers a 401(K) you should do that as well. <br>
 <br>
An IRA or Roth IRA can easily be started with a Bank or investing firm. You&#039;ll want to set up the IRA as well as an autodraft to put money into the IRA if you&#039;re paid on a regular basis. Normally you might want to contribute 5-15% to your IRA or 401(k) if you&#039;re young. Being that you&#039;re starting a little older you&#039;ll want to contribute as much as possible. Go to your local bank or credit union to get an idea of what you&#039;ll need to do. It&#039;s easy, and they can provide a variety of calculators to give you an idea of what you might expect for retirement income based on contributions, potential market returns and the age at which you retire. <br>
 <br>
The big decision you&#039;ll need to make is what to invest in. Although there&#039;s a plethera of investing advice, typically most savy investors will tell the average Joe like yourself to invest in high to mid risk mutual funds. Even during volitile markets like the one we&#039;re experiencing now, these types of funds have historically yielded 10-12% interest over the last 100 years. As you get older, or when you see retirements approaching, you&#039;ll want to decrease your risk to minimize losses that might occur before and during retirement. But at your age you&#039;ll still want to invest using relatively high risk mutual funds or ETF&#039;s (exchange traded funds) to maximize your returns. Yes, you&#039;ll experience a higher loss with higher risk, but over the long term, 25 years or so for you, this will also yield the best returns. It probably seems a little daunting so talk to your bank or credit union for more information.
        </p> It is never too late to start. The hardest part is starting. Check to see if there is a 401(k) where you work. If not speak to someone at your bank or a CPA. Start by saving a small amount at first and then if you can afford it you can start in creasing the amount you save. Once you start then stick with it and before you know it you will have monies saved so you will be able to retire.
        </p> It&#039;s late but not too late.  If you&#039;re switching you job anytime soon try to find a job that offers 401k as your priority.  You can also put extra income about $50-$100 per month.
        </p> I&#039;d speak to some one at your bank or a CPA to see what would be best for you.
