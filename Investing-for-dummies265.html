<h1>Investing for dummies?</h1>
<div class="answer">im a complete novice to investing, i am currently reading investing online for dummies, is that a good place to start. i am also planning to read &amp;quot;the intelligent investor&amp;quot; benjamin graham. is that too much of a big leap.

where can i get good real time simulators. and free information on businesses. because you have to pay for FT***

when you buy shares and make a profit, and then sell does the monye come directly to your account?(is it like paypal, you have to transfer money from online brokerage to bank account)

sorry for all the Q&amp;#39;s thanks<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> I´ve been investing for more than 20 years and trading for almost 14, and I can tell you that if you want to make BIG and FAST profits, I recommend you trading rather than investing, trading can help you to go from rags to rich. <br>
 <br>
If you are investing, you must have already achieved some degree of financial success, long term stock investing and/or FOREX can help you become much richer than you are today. <br>
 <br>
My experiences as a Nasdaq Market Maker, Head trader of brokerage firms, and currently as a professional trader <br>
and private hedge fund manager, I can suggest you that: <br>
 <br>
We trade because we want quick, short term profits on a consistent basis. We want to cash flow the market. Milk it like a cow. <br>
Make consistent, small, short term gains rather than trying to hit a home run on every trade. Don&#039;t ever forget that. <br>
Don&#039;t marry a stock, marry the idea of making money trading stocks. That&#039;s the only way to do it. <br>
 <br>
For me &quot;All stocks are equally worthless” <br>
 <br>
I don&#039;t hold on to any illusion that the stock market will continue to go up and provide a nice retirement for me. <br>
I could care less which way the market goes. It&#039;s irrelevant to me if the market goes higher, crashes or moves sideways for the next 50 years. I really could care less. Stocks are just four letters with two prices next to them that I use to make a living trading. <br>
 <br>
Trade ONLY when you have a clear, easy and identifiable advantage, because without a CLEAR EDGE your odds of success are NO better than a flip of a coin… That´s why so many new traders (and investors) lose money. <br>
 <br>
Take a look at any daily chart of any index or stock and you&#039;ll probably see the most volatility and the biggest opportunity for profit during the &quot;First Hour&quot; of the stock market&#039;s opening. <br>
 <br>
The popular thinking and conventional wisdom is that you should wait about an hour before you start trading. <br>
 <br>
But if you do, you&#039;ll miss the big, fast moves that stocks make as all the amateurs let their emotions out through their <br>
online accounts, usually right after they read some news headline or hear Maria Bartiromo go off about a stock on CNBC. <br>
 <br>
It&#039;s easy to see why trading the open is the market&#039;s prime time for profiting from other online traders. <br>
The market&#039;s open is very volatile - that is the perfect environment for LARGE, FAST profits. <br>
 <br>
Learn to trade as a professional Market Maker ,not as an emotionally driven amateur trader or investor with few thousand dollars in an account at Etrade. <br>
 <br>
There isn&#039;t any other time during the day or any stock you can invest in, that can make you 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 or more points <br>
in minutes OTHER than during the first hour the stock market is open. That&#039;s why I love trading the open so much. <br>
 <br>
I trade only when I have an edge and that means &quot;only the fisrt hour the market is open&quot;. <br>
 <br>
If you are a beginning trader, you can give yourself an unfair advantage in the market trading this way. <br>
 <br>
I can continue giving you a lot of advises about how to make money trading, but if you ask me: <br>
&quot;What is the best thing you can do for me or that I can do for myself? <br>
 <br>
Go to this &quot;Top Secret&quot; site and get the BEST stocks that will make the largest and fastest day trading profits you´ve ever seen... <br>
 <br>
***onehourtrading*** <br>
 <br>
After you review this site you won´t need a system, strategy, book, software or mentor to tell you what to do, <br>
you will be able to profit HUGE every day, picking your own stocks to trade. <br>
 <br>
Trade well, <br>
 <br>

        </p> Binary options let users trade in currency pairs and stocks for various predetermined time-periods, minimal of which is 30 seconds. Executing trades is straightforward. The system uses user-friendly interfaces, which even an 8 years old kid, can operate without having to read any instructions. But winning trades is Not easy.  <br>
Binary trading is advertised as the only genuine system that lets users earn preposterous amounts of money in ridiculously short period of time. Advertisers try to implicate as if you can make $350 every 60 seconds; if it was true then binary trading would truly be an astonishing business.  <br>
However, does it make any sense? Can every trader make tons of money in binary trading? Who is actually paying all the money or the profit to traders?  <br>
The first challenge is finding a trustworthy binary broker; secondly, you need to find a binary trading strategy, which you can use to make profits consistently. Without an effective trading strategy, there is no way you can make money in this business. <br>

It seems like Trading is almost totally based on Macro-economics. It also strikes me that since there are not nearly as many currencies as there are stocks/bonds/derivatives etc etc, there must be a large number of market players in each currency bracket. So logically, currencies must be very liquid true? Also, what is the risk of Currency trading, high or low? When I read the business section every day I notice that the Canadian loonie moves hardly a tenth of a cent on a regular basis (in comparison to the US dollar). So it seems like theres very little room for growth in currencies unless you leverage. On that note, whats the maximum leverage permitted for forex trading. I know in stocks its x2, and in derivatives its x10. Anyway the only way to know how to start a profitable buisness is by following some methods like the one that I suggested.
