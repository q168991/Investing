<h1>Good stock investing courses and books?</h1>
<div class="answer">Looking for a good course or book to learn about stock investing from thanks :)<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> The single best general investing book is &quot;The Only Investment Guide You&#039;ll Ever Need&quot; by Andrew Tobias.  Read it, re-read it, pay attention.  Seriously. <br>
 <br>
After you have that base of knowledge, you can move to something more specialized.  You ask about stock investing:  in my view, books are the better way, as opposed to courses.  Generally, if you&#039;re taking a course nowadays, it seems the teacher really is just trying to sell his or her &quot;trading method.&quot;  Don&#039;t bother. <br>
 <br>
Next, I have found the &quot;for dummies&quot; series a good overview of many different subjects, so check out &quot;Stock Investing For Dummies.&quot; <br>
 <br>
Follow this with Benjamin Graham&#039;s &quot;The Intelligent Investor&quot; and &quot;The Essays of Warren Buffett,&quot; edited by Lawrence Cunningham.  You might also look at &quot;Use the News,&quot; by Maria Bartiromo. <br>
 <br>
Carefully avoid books by someone who is trying to sell ads, such as on a tv show (i.e., don&#039;t bother with Suze Orman books, etc.).  Many &quot;investing book&quot; lists include Peter Lynch&#039;s &quot;One Up on Wall Street&quot; and various tomes by Charles Schwab--not really the best way to go, in my experience. <br>
 <br>
Simply start with the Andrew Tobias book--the single best investing book, period--you&#039;ll be well on your way to intelligent investing.

        </p> Hey Josh, <br>
 <br>
There are a ton of books out there on investing (and on Warren Buffett -- probably the best value investor out there...), but here are some of my favorites, and ones that I think are worth reading... <br>
 <br>
The Intelligent Investor - probably one of the greatest books on value investing, written by the master Benjamin Graham - with forward by Warren Buffett <br>
 <br>
One Up On Wall Street - one of the first books I read on investing, and still one of my favorites.  Peter Lynch gives simple investing advice on what companies you should invest in and what to look for <br>
 <br>
The Warren Buffett Way - an excellent book on describing Warren Buffett&#039;s investment style.  Easy to understand and valuable information <br>
 <br>
Security Analysis:  The Classic 1940 Edition - for those of you who want more meat in your reading, try Security Analysis.  This is the classic text of value investing, digging into what to look for and beware of in researching companies and buying their securities - both stocks and bonds <br>
 <br>
Buffett:  The Making of an American Capitalist - this is probably the definitive biography on Warren Buffett - giving you not only an insight into his investing philosophy, but into his life.  A must read if you want to know what makes Warren Buffett tick... <br>
 <br>
As you can probably tell, I&#039;m an advocate of value investing (finding great companies to invest in, buying them at the right price, and selling them only when they become overvalued...).  These books are a great start of the value investing approach. <br>
 <br>
Hope this helps, and good luck!
