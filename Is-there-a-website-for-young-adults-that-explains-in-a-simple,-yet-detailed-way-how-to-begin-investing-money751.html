<h1>Is there a website for young adults that explains in a simple, yet detailed way how to begin investing money?</h1>
<div class="answer">I know pretty much zero about investing, but I would like to start putting my money somewhere where I could eventually make a profit. I&amp;#39;m just beginning college, so I don&amp;#39;t want and can&amp;#39;t to invest lots of money.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

Two websites you can check out. Best way to start investing is to just by setting aside a small about each week or month i.e. 25.00/week and letting it set in a savings account until you find a certain investment you would like. Whatever you do make sure that the investment is something you are comfortable with. And whatever anyone tells you nothing will guarantee a return except goverment obligations such as government issued bongs and banks. OTher than that there is risk. However risk isn&#039;t necessarily bad. Just research before you buy.

</script><p> The first step in investing is to learn the &quot;Rule of 72&quot;. <br>
http://***ruleof72.net/ <br>
Don&#039;t buy anything at this website, but learn the rule and play around with the numbers a bit. <br>
 <br>
2 cool things to try... <br>
 <br>
1. Take the interest percentage that you are getting at your bank and calculate how long it will take one dollar to double to $2. <br>
 <br>
2. Assume that you were given $2000 at birth and you invested it and received an average 10% return every year until you reached 65 years old. Do the same with 5% and 2% <br>
 <br>
You are wise to start investing early. Start young and you will be a rich woman when you retire. <br>
 <br>
The other keyword is DIVERSFIY. As they say...Don&#039;t put all your eggs in one basket. <br>
 <br>
Have fun. <br>
Get rich!
        </p> I don&#039;t get it either, but I don&#039;t dance at all at shows anyways. I pretty much just stand and watch. For me the show is all about soaking in the sounds and what the band is doing. I&#039;m by no means saying that there is a right or a wrong, that&#039;s just how I do it. Pits though or moreso the moshing mentality, for me, can be terribly annoying. I&#039;ve been to shows, wanting to hang out and watch the group and even being towards the back of a small venue being crashed into by some jerk who is &quot;feeling it.&quot; I don&#039;t think that it&#039;s always wrong or anything. Do what you want to do and enjoy your show experience the way it&#039;s best for you. My problem is when there is a sort of pitted area (or it isn&#039;t really a slamming audience) and people extend the mentality out to where it isn&#039;t going on. I intentionally separate myself from the pits and expect a degree of courtesy from other people at shows. I really hate it when some overzealous jerk feels like he has the right to elbow me in the gut, or rush straight into me simply because we&#039;re both at the same show. It hasn&#039;t happened in a long time because I&#039;ve just sort of started to gravitate to mellower shows as I&#039;ve gotten older but it really used to bug me. I guess that isn&#039;t really an answer, but more so the question sparked a rant for me so thanks for endulging me. I don&#039;t really get it either.

        </p> your best bet is to inest in a no load mutual fund directly.  Minimums are usually $500 or so to get started.  Let me know if you want specific recommendations. <br>
 <br>
If your not ready for a mutual fund, start with a money market account, I recommend ING Direct (***ingdirect***).  They have good interest rates and it is easy to set up.
        </p> the place to go is Investopedia*** they have lots of info and a simulator that works with the real markets where you can practice prfecting your plans of attack <br>
 <br>
Dictionary, Articles, Tutorials, Message Boards it has it all
