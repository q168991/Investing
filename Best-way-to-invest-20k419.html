Best you study trends in areas you are thinking of investing in. ie, is there a new highway going through an area that will open up easy access to work etc. Land value in the outlying town the highway is connected to will become more attractive in that case therefore push up the property value. <br>
 <br>
Population trends - is there an area that is relatively inexpensive at the moment and is it likely to be &#039;discovered&#039; in the future? If so the properties there will become sort after and the values will go up. <br>
 <br>
20k is not a lot of money. I doubt it will be enough to by a property outright so you may need to also consider such things as  borrowing extra money. Can you afford the repayments and if you decide to put a tenant in your rental property, is the property in an area where rental properties are in demand. <br>
 <br>
There are a lot of things to consider. Don&#039;t let anyone talk you into something you do not feel right about. I don&#039;t know about England but here in Australia if you sign a contract for a property, you have a three day cooling off period where you can change your mind so long as you put it in writing within the three days. <br>
 <br>
Until you are sure about what you want to do, leave the money in the bank and set it up in an account that will offset the interest on your loan repayments. <br>
 <br>
I personally love the property market though you have to be lucky to buy in the right place and time to make a high turnover in three years. The property market is usually a longer term investment.  <br>
 <br>
Anyway I hope this helps. Study the trends, don&#039;t do anything without thorough investigation because there are a lot of pitfalls and if it sounds tooooooo good to be true you are probably right.
        </p> Investing abroad is a good idea. China, in particular. Since foriegners have been allowed to buy property in Shanghai for instance (since 2001) it&#039;s gone up 400%.  Still lots of room to climb.  But even better, just long term lease old rundown property here, renovate and re-lease to the end user for a much higher rate. Can achieve 200% yeild in a lot of cases.  It works because the gov&#039;t owns all the old crappy buildings and doesn&#039;t have the knowhow/ambition to do it themselves.  The government will allow you to rent very low from them because the buildings are just empty and wasting gov&#039;t money so if you pay them enough that it doesn&#039;t cost them anything and fix it up they&#039;ll be happy.  Then you can re-rent for great prices.  This idea is going to pick up very soon but for now it&#039;s still very unknown.
        </p> If you want to invest in real estate, look at the fastest growing cities in US or if you want to risk it the world.  Then call local real estate agents to get a better feel about the area and what oppertunities there are.  With a couple of phone calls you should be getting an idea of whats going on.  However, global trends are seeing a slow down for the next couple of years so it might not be a good time to invest.
        </p> lol I work for Dimension Home Loans in South Africa. I know all about property here.  In South Africa the housing is a briellient way to invest. <br>
 <br>
The best areas now are Gauteng, as they are now cheap and are going up in Valuation very quickly. I jus bought 2 properties in Krugersdorp for R175 000, its now been a year and a half and I can sell for R390 000. That more than double
        </p> Be careful! Learn a lot about the rules of investing before putting money in the markets! I have seen too many people lose in this game. Check out websites of nasdaq, nyse, and cboe (all with ***) for info. A good site for resources, trading materials, training, courses etc is: <br>

If u can&#039;t decide just buy a bond fund, and earn that 6%. <br>

        </p> Buying more property (and renting it out) and you are on the ladder later you can borrow the equity in the new property and buy another here. Choose carefully when buying property abroad find out lots about lettabillity and check their local government planning.  Well done and good luck in your venture

That&#039;s all I know, but maybe you can get lucky at the lottery or the casino, but if you&#039;re really desperate, sell your house and buy a cheaper house abroad.
        </p> I&#039;de use it on the stocks, much more exciting...buy stocks in Microsoft. <br>
