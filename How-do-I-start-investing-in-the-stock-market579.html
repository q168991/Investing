 <br>
Open up a portfolio without using real money. You can give yourself as much or as little money to try out the market. The stocks you want to focus on is consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and healthcare. These are DEFENSIVE stocks that will survive through good and bad times. Most of my positions are in these stocks. Some names include 3M, Procter &amp; Gamble, Kimberly Clark, Exxon Mobil, Walmart, Costco. Everybody&#039;s got to eat and wipe their butts regardless of the state of economy. Many of these companies survived through the Great Depression. <br>
 <br>
That&#039;s the benefits. You can sleep at night knowing your money is doing well. There are NO guarantees that you won&#039;t lose money. It&#039;s just that these stocks are the best. They pay good dividends too. <br>
 <br>
Then once you&#039;re comfortable and test the waters of the market, you can finally put some real money in. Go to Scottrade***. They&#039;re excellent for beginners. <br>
 <br>
If you&#039;re new to stocks, DON&#039;T DAY TRADE. You&#039;ll a rookie in a world of professionals. I tried day-trading with Citigroup and AIG when they were a little bit over $1. I had some luck at first, making about $30 a day but I was way over my head. My luck didn&#039;t last long and I had to rethink my strategy. <br>
 <br>
Day trading involves A LOT of commissions to the broker. With all the commissions deducted from each trade, you&#039;ll be lucky if you only lose half your money. <br>
 <br>
I would just day trade using Yahoo! Finance. Open a stimulation account, give yourself $100 worth of fake money and play it in the stimulation format. You&#039;ll see what I mean by losing money every easily. <br>
 <br>
Good luck.
        </p> Investing in the stock market is a great way to make money online. however, if you don&#039;t know what you are doing, you can lose more than you earn. Before you start, learn some stock market basics, like selecting the right stock to trade, timing your entry and exits from trades, and risk management.
        </p> Investing takes a lot of knowledge. <br>
 <br>
With this knowledge, you will be able to lower risk significantly. But you have to be willing to learn about it. <br>
 <br>
There are only two ways to analyze stocks to invest in them. 1. Fundamental Analysis and 2. Technical Analsis.  <br>
 <br>
I suggest you take the time out to learn #1. I&#039;ve learned both, and actually learned about  #2 before I learned #1. I can tell you right now, #1 is head over heels better. <br>
 <br>
Technical Analysis bases your investment decision on charts, patterns, moving averages, and market behavior.. I don&#039;t know about you, but that is not good enough reason for me to put my hard money down for. It&#039;s also used by many many day traders who are basically using the stock market as a casino. I would not go this route. <br>
 <br>
Fundamental Analysis is what you should learn. It has helped me a lot in understanding the world of business and investing. It helps me assess risk based on concrete evidence from the financial statements of companies.. things like that.    <br>
 <br>
Start learning about the &quot;fundamentals.&quot; It will be well worth it. <br>
It is the investment style of the great ones such as Warren Buffet.
        </p> First, you should make sure that you have enough cash on hand in the event of something unexpected, like the loss of a job. Then, you should decide how often you will make trades.  <br>
 <br>
If you are going to trade frequently, I would recommend a discount broker because their commissions are much lower. However, you are completely on your own in terms of research and selecting stocks. If you go for a full-service broker, you will get useful advice on your investments, but the commissions will be much higher. However, full-service brokers are useful, and highly recommended when the purpose of the investment is something extremely crucial such as retirement or education.  <br>
 <br>
If you go for a discount broker, there are several good brokers such as Ameritrade, Etrade, Scottrade, Sharebuilder and many others. I have used Sharebuilder and Scottrade. Both are good brokers. However, Scottrade charges $7 per trade, which is something to consider if you are going to be trade frequently. Other brokers may offer you more services but you will have to pay higher commissions. Also, Scottrade and Sharebuilder have no account minimums. With Scottrade, however, there is a requirement to have a minimum initial investment of $500 but after the account is open, any level is permitted with no charge.
        </p> am a professional and I will tell you what my clients pay me thousands in advisory fees for, get the book How to Make Money in Stocks by William O&#039;Neil. It will teach you from the beginning how the stock market works and the best stocks to work with. The part that differentiates is the Market aspect of the CANSLIM formula. O&#039;Neils system timed out the market in March of 2000 and September of 2008 and marked the turnaround on March 12 2009. Everybody is lost. It takes time to learn, so before you put real money in, paper trade using Yahoo Portfolios.
        </p> You open a brokerage account, transfer some money and buy sell stocks. If you don&#039;t know which stock you want, you can try broad indexes like QQQQ or SPY. But stock market has been over valued for the last 2 decades and it seems to be coming down. Before betting too much of your money, you must educate yourself: <br>
