</script><p> Hi, <br>
 <br>
   If I were young, I would be investing in small cap growth mutual funds or stocks.  Go here for excellent low cost advice (http://***aaii***/aaiiportfolios/comme... <br>
 <br>
   Don&#039;t be alarmed at the low cost - it has some of the best financial advice on the Web. <br>
 <br>
     You have lots of time before retirement which means the magic of compound interest will just keep building and building.  It really works and if you keep investing every year, in 10 or 15 years you will be surprised at how it mounts up.  In 30 years you could be a millionaire which probably won&#039;t amount to much in 30 year owing the the ravages of inflation. <br>
 <br>
  And that&#039;s the primary reason to keep investing in small cap growth stocks - they will flog inflation to death. <br>
 <br>
   When investing in mutual funds, select the no-load funds only.  Do not invest in mutual funds with a &quot;load&quot;, an up front commission that you have to pay before when they sell you the mutual fund.  Some charge as much as 10% which is a rrip-off.  Many studies have shown that the no-load funds do as well as the load funds and sometimes a lot better. <br>
 <br>
   Look at the AAI Shadow Stock Portfolio.  I would try and emulate that portfolio if you want to invest in stocks.  It was up 25% as of November 2006.  The Vanguard Index fund is only up 14%. <br>
 <br>
   AAII has some of the best financial advisers and the cost is very low.   They have excellent guides and advice. <br>
 <br>
  You may need a broker so go to e-Trade or Scottsdale who have low commission rates. <br>
 <br>
   Do your own due diligence.  Your own ideas are the best.  Do not depend on someone else to select investments for you.  Learn about investing so you don&#039;t have to ask what stocks to invest in.   <br>
 <br>
   Be self reliant.   <br>
 <br>
   Remember what Emerson said:  A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. <br>
 <br>
   Find stocks that have steadily rising net profits (earnings), low debt, and good P/Es, lots of cash, companies buying back their stock.. <br>
 <br>
   What interests you?  Find stocks that pique your interest and passion. <br>
 <br>
  You need fast growing good stocks with good earnings and in good sectors.  You need to learn more about the stock market before you even think about investing in it. <br>
 <br>
  The stocks world is divided into 12 sectors such as energy which chevron belongs to.  It is next to last in the sectors list today. <br>
 <br>
   Technology is numero uno, but things can change in a new york minute, but within the sector, the fastest growing are computer services, not Microsoft.  Then,  Electronic Instruments and controls.  Next is computer storage devices. <br>
 <br>
   The next hot sector is Healthcare, but heed the warning below.  Go here for sectors:  (http://clearstation.etrade***/cgi-bin/I... <br>
 <br>
  The best software is Vector Vest if you can afford it.  It has sector investing. <br>
 <br>
   Here is a free Web site for charting stocks:  (http://***incrediblecharts***/). <br>
 <br>
   First of all, stay away from &quot;professional brokers&quot; and tips coming to you via e-mail or friends and acquaintances.   And tips at Yahoo! Answers.  And e-mail tips.  Do your own due diligence - don&#039;t rely on someone else.  Read Emerson&#039;s essay &quot;Self Reliance. <br>
 <br>
   Hey!  They will say anything to get you to buy their junk.  If it&#039;s too good to be true, it is. <br>
 <br>
   Remember this, they are just sales people trying to sell you what their firm is pushing.  They are not security analysts or financial planners, not even financial advisers.  Trust me, I know from experience that they cannot be trusted especially with a million dollars.  You risk losing it all.  A million dollar account is known as a &quot;whale&quot; and they would love to get their greedy little paws on it and suck it dry.  They just want to make commissions on what they buy and sell for the suckers, err...clients.. <br>
 <br>
   Risk avoidance is the name of the game. <br>
 <br>
   Remember, the harder I work, the luckier I get.   <br>
 <br>
   Penny stocks are highly speculative.  I would avoid the ones under a dollar a share.  For example, Best Buy started at less than $5.  So there are some good companies, but it takes a lot of digging to find the good ones.  You are looking for companies with good earnings, little debt, low capitalization, and good P/Es.  For stocks under $5, very few will meet these requirements. <br>
 <br>
   Stay away from the pharms unless they have patented drugs - do not invest in generic pharms,  no growth there. <br>
 <br>
  Check out which business sectors are the most popular and invest in the companies in those sectors.  The number one, two and three are:  technology, health care, and cyclicals (retail).  These change periodically so keep current. <br>
 <br>

   There are these lists all over the Web - you pays your money and takes your chances. <br>

   Rule #1: The Simple Strategy for Successful Investing in Only 15 Minutes a Week!  by Phil Town .  See his Web site at (http://***ruleoneinvestor***/).  Free sign-up.  I got the book at the library. <br>
 <br>
   Listen.  You don&#039;t have to spend a lot of money on these books - most can be found at your library and those that your library doesn&#039;t have they can usually get from other libraries in your state. <br>
 <br>
   Most of these books talk about stock and mutual fund investing, but for a good introduction to other forms of investing Gerald Appel has a great book called Opportunity Investing - How to Profit When Stock Advance, Stocks decline, Inflation Run Rampant, Prices fall, Oil Prices Hit the Roof and Every Time In Between. <br>
 <br>
   First, Break All the Rules: What the World&#039;s Greatest Managers Do Differently by Marcus Buckingham and Curt Coffman   Not a book on investing, but it&#039;s a nice segue into the next book. <br>
 <br>
   Now, Discover Your Strengths by Marcus Buckingham and Donald O. Clifton  <br>
 <br>
   Go Put Your Strengths to Work: 6 Powerful Steps to Achieve Outstanding Performance by Marcus Buckingham  <br>
 <br>
   Finding your strengths is important when investing.  These books teach you to build on your strengths, what you a good at.  Everyone is good or passionate about  something.  Why not get better at what you are good at? <br>
 <br>
  Another good book is:  Opportunity Investing: How To Profit When Stocks Advance, Stocks Decline, Inflation Runs Rampant, Prices Fall, Oil Prices Hit the Roof, ... and Every Time in Between (Hardcover) <br>
by Gerald Appel <br>
 <br>
   Most mutual funds do not even keep up the the return on the S&amp;P.  That&#039;s like 99% of them. <br>
 <br>
  Vanguard Index funds are a no brainer. <br>
 <br>
   A CD is better than a savings account.  They range from six months to several years.  You cannot touch your money tho until the time limit is up. <br>
 <br>
   Check out this Web site on Direct Investment Plans where you can buy shares directly from companies:  (http://***fool***/School/DRIPs.htm).  Usually no fees and you can buy one share at a time. <br>
 <br>
   Bonds are probably the safest.  But they are not for the young.  You might try a bond fund.  They might return 5 or 6 percent.  At 5% a million would return $50,000 a year - not a bad income.  Remember, you have to pay taxes on the $50,000. <br>
 <br>
   There are also municipal bonds and the income from them is taxfree especially if you buy them in a state that offers them, but they only pay about 3%, but it&#039;s mostly taxfree. <br>
 <br>
   Look into Fidelity sector funds.  Buy the top three, then in six months look how they are doing and if not so hot, select the next three that are best.  Do this for a few years and you will make lots of money. <br>

P.S.  This is a life-long learning process.  Reading these books and applying the rules to analyzing stocks that may be good   It takes time.  Be patient and keep reading and listening.  Don&#039;t be a sucker and follow someone elses advice.  Be your own man or woman.  Depend on no one except yourself.  You can only get smarter and stronger that way. <br>
 <br>
P.P.S.  Internet has lots of good stuff, for example (http://stockcharts***/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_average_conve <br>
Stockcharts*** is very good and their discussion of MACD is one of the best, barring its originator, Gerald Apple, but now we are getting into Technical Analysis and that is not for beginners.  But it is an important factor in finding good stocks that are going up and growing.  Remember, tiny acorns grow into mighty oaks. <br>
 <br>
P.P.P.S.    There is a way to invest in stocks without a broker and if you keep reading I will tell you how. <br>
 <br>
   The method is called DRIPs.   <br>
 <br>
   A DRIP is a Dividend Reinvestment Plan.  It offers indidual investors, even a15 year old, a cost-effective way to build equity in a stock.   <br>
 <br>
The DRIP is run by a corporation and it allows people to make cash purchases of stock or to reinvest dividends (if any).  I have a DRIP program with Goodyear Tire and Rubber, but it ran into problems a few years ago and stopped paying dividends. <br>
 <br>
You only need one share of stock to become eligible.  In some cases it can be purchased directly from the company, but normally needs to be purchased through a broker.  You could have your parents open up an brokerage account and purchase the share in your name. <br>
 <br>
There are no fees or commissions when you reinvest your dividends. <br>
 <br>
There are lots of companies that do this - over 1000.  The company likes them because it&#039;s a low cost way to get capital or cash for their business.  Because of that companies welcome new investors into their DRIP plans. <br>
 <br>
What makes DRIP popular is that most of the plans require very small cash outlays even as low as $10, some as low as $5. <br>
 <br>
Some of the world&#039;s largest companies like IBM, AT&amp;T, and McDonald&#039;s have DRIPs. <br>
 <br>
Very wealthy investor like DRIPs because it allows them to bypass the broker&#039;s commisssion which lowers the investors cost of investing <br>
 <br>
Another benefit is known as dollar-cost averaging where a fixed amount is invested on a regular basis.  The stock rises and falls with the market, but by investing periodically, the average cost of the shares tends to average out and not be affected by the market swings. <br>
 <br>
Liquidating or selling your shares can be a problem because brokers want to get a commission for selling and buying stock for investors, but the company will buy them back in some cases. <br>
 <br>
Dividends are considered income and used to  be taxed by the IRS, but a change in the law makes them non-taxable.  But if you sell your shares and make a profit you have to pay tax on the profit.  There are two types of taxes for profits or capital gains:  one is short term and costs more than the other kind of capital gain which is called a long-term capital gain and that occurs when you hold a stock for more than six months. <br>
 <br>
Goodyear Tire and Rubber&#039;s stock symbol is GT, but don&#039;t invest in this one because it doesn&#039;t pay a dividend yet.. <br>
 <br>
YUM is the symbol for Yum! Brands, Inc and they own Pizza Hut, Taco Bell, and Kentucky Fried Chicken on the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) <br>
 <br>
This Web site has a list of DRIPs:  http://***directinvesting***/ <br>
 <br>
To find DRIPs that pay good dividends, look in Investors Business Daily, Barrons, or the Wall Street Journal.  There is a column that has dividends and return %.  Most don&#039;t pay as much as a Treasury Note or a CD, but they have earnings growth to offset that income disadvantage.  Than look them up in the URL above. <br>
 <br>
Google this keyword &quot;DRIP lists&quot; for more Web site.  Be careful.  Some of them charge a fee to sign up. <br>

</script><p> Being how you are very young and can afford to take risks investing in a market index fund such as SPY is the best way to go.  This will give you returns that are basically equal to what the S&amp;P 500 does over the same time.  I would say this is a better investment then just throwing the money in a savings account because history have shown that over time the markets will be out the interest percent that you will see from a savings account or from bonds.
        </p> If you aren&#039;t planning on spending the money in the near future (ie college) your best bet is probably to stick it in the stock market. <br>
 <br>
You can actually do this quite easily by opening a brokerage account (***scottrade***, ***tradeking***, etc) and buying shares of what are known as exchange traded funds. These are essentially mutual funds that trade on the stock market, and allow you to own a little stock in a lot of companies (which saves you the trouble of researching stocks and eliminates the change that you&#039;ll pick a bad stock.)  <br>
 <br>
Examples that track the S&amp;P 500 (a listing of the 500 biggest US stocks) are the SPDR fund (picker symbol SPY) and the iShares fund (IVV). <br>
 <br>
Because the market is very volatile and can go down in the near term I wouldn&#039;t recommend this if you&#039;re planning on using the money to pay for college. If that&#039;s the case you might see about putting your money in money markets.
