</script><p> It depends on your risk tolerance and when you will need the money.  A few general rules are NEVER invest in fixed annuities and a low cost way to get the return of the market is to open an account at scottrade or another online broker and just buy market based ETFs like VTI (vanguard total market), SPY (S&amp;P 500), and QQQQ (Nasdaq).  All three of those have very low expenses and offer you instant diversification.  Scottrade has $7 trades so I try to trade $1400 at a time making the commission a mere 1/2% of the transaction.

</script><p> 91% of how well you do over time is told by how well allocated you are.  Diversification is a big piece and you receive this by purchasing mutual funds.  I would suggest an allocation fund.  There are a ton of different options but just pick one that has a solid fund manager and you should stay at the top of the class in terms of returns and low volitillity for a long time.  As for where I suggest using a Roth or a Traditional IRA these are great tools that can give you tax breaks.   <br>
 <br>
If you are looking to invest more in stocks I would reccommend a 20% stock and 80% mutual funds portfolio this way you will always have solid footing but you might get lucky with one of the stocks you chose..
        </p> If you have a 401K plan max that out first or as much as you can. Most of these programs are matched by the company to some extent and that is free money. I heard the other day that saving $4,000 a year from age19-24 was equivalent to saving $4,000 a year from age 29 till retirement. Both were estimated at $1.2 million total. All compound interest of course. ROTH IRA would be best after tax, but if you need more liquidity use a good diverse money market. Within either vehicle you can diversify to keep your investments growing even in the worst of times. Playing a particular stock is like pulling the handle on a one arm bandit. I would rather put my money in the hands of people who have been investing peoples money for 20-30 years (Fund Managers).
        </p> For people wanting to invest, but don’t know where to invest, they can consider investments in mutual funds. These funds offer a varied investment opportunity for the shareholders who have bought the fund’s shares. They are an effective method of building a varied investment portfolio, or they can augment your existing portfolio with securities chosen by the mutual fund manager. Refer to this guide about detailed explanation of the mutual funds. <br>

        </p> This penny stock service has years of proven experience. Ultimately it is the best service for beginners to use https://tr.im/MzrjC  <br>
You will have to wait between 3 and 10 days to get into the system in most cases. When I signed up it took 8 days. I wished it was faster, but if you can wait a week or two to start earn life changing money than you will have what it takes to make it in this business.
        </p> This is just me but I would save it rather then invest it. If you invest it, lets say in stocks of a certain company, you have a chance of loosing what you invested if the price of stocks go down.

        </p> Hi, A excellent way to invest your money is going to a bank and talking to a personal banker and see what they can offer. They explain in detail your options.I started a year ago and I have seen excellent revenue. So good luck and please dont hesitate.
        </p> you are able to desire to open a &quot;procuring and advertising account&quot; with a proportion/inventory broking provider in India. this could be used to place purchase and sell orders of shares on your call. you are able to desire to open a &quot;demat account&quot; with the comparable proportion broking provider ( for sake of straight forward and straight forward appropriate operations) or the different enterprise ( like banks ) to maintain the shares you will purchase. you choose money. this could be with the aid of your financial organisation account. you are able to desire to submit account beginning up varieties and correct records to the broking provider. And whilst each and every little thing is so as, you purely place purchase and sell orders. in case you choose greater counsel, please digital mail me. Am in the comparable container for a protracted time and based in Mumbai - the financial capital of India!
