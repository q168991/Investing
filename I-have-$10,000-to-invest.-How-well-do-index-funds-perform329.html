<h1>I have $10,000 to invest. How well do index funds perform?</h1>
<div class="answer">I&amp;#39;d like to put my money into an index fund that requires a minimum of $10,000. Is placing all of my money into an index fund a safe enough strategy? Or should I distribute that $10,000 across a spectrum of investments to minimize risk? Will I see any decent gains if I do?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> As another poster pointed out. Vanguard has the lowest <br>
cost for index funds.Try the Total Market Index Fund for <br>
best diversification. You can invest your $10,000 into the <br>
fund all at once.  This fund has a cost of 0.18% and the  <br>
symbol is (VTSMX) Over the life of the fund it has a return <br>
of aproxamitly 8%.

        </p> Buying one stock as you can imagine is very dangerous, so be careful of the idiots that will tout their favorite stock. <br>
 <br>
Index ETF&#039;s or Index Mutual Funds are the only way many people and institutions invest in the market.  Although I don&#039;t do this... it&#039;s still a good illegitimate way to invest.  Asking if it&#039;s &quot;safe&quot; tells me you have little understanding of the markets.  This lack of understanding can hurt you.  No investment that includes stocks is ever &quot;safe&quot;.... no matter how diversified.  On the other hands you want &quot;decent gains&quot;... Decent gains and safe are mutually exclusive. <br>
 <br>
Learn about the stock market and learn about &quot;Asset Allocation&quot;.... between the two you&#039;ll be able to navigate the risky waters. <br>
 <br>
I don&#039;t like Vanguard for investors under age 50..... but if you&#039;re only investing in index funds they are absolutely the best (and least expensive) Mutual Fund company to deal with. <br>
 <br>
Read some books. Start investing. Over long periods of time, if your &quot;Asset Allocation&quot; is good... you&#039;ll do well.
        </p> An index fund already diversifies your risk, the more wide ranging an index fund, the more diversified the investment.  For example, an S&amp;P 500 index fund (say SPY etf) invests in a weighted portfolio made up of the 500 companies that make up the S&amp;P index. <br>
 <br>
There is no advantage to looking for a fund with a $10,000 minimum.  An index fund invests its money based on weights and specific stocks and your $10,000 has no more influence than my investment of $100or any less influence than my investment of $1,000,000.  The $1,000,000 fund invests in exactly the same stocks and proportionally the same percent of shares as the $100,000,000 fund, so they each go up and down the same and your $10,000 goes up and down the same in either fund. <br>
 <br>
In any case, your money is as safe as the particular index you are investing in.  If you invest in the S&amp;P 500 and the S&amp;P prices go down, your investment loses money.  However, it is less likely that with a 500 stock fund, you will see drops or increases that would be as varied as say a Dow Transportation index fund such as the iShare Transportation etf - these sector specific funds invest only in stocks in a particular sector and their fortunes rise and fall with the sector itself, not the overall market, so if transportations are down, maybe due to gas prices, while the S&amp;P 500 is up, maybe due to the profits from gas prices, you would lose if you are in the transportation fund while you would make money in the S&amp;P 500.
        </p> Index funds generally perform at the same level as the stock index they track. So, you are doing no better or no worse than that market.  It&#039;s another way of saying mediocrity.  The goal of investing is usually to beat the market, not do exactly what the market is doing.
        </p> They perform exactly like the index they are intended to duplicate. Whether it is safe or not depends on the index - I would stick with the S&amp;P 500 or Russell 2000 indexes. Could you still lose money? Of course, if the market goes down.
        </p> Trading binary options online is not as complicated as many people think it is. Read here https://tr.im/4Lj0I <br>
 <br>
You don’t have to be an economics expert in order to make money by trading binary options. The charts allow you to predict the future course of an asset by finding patterns in its past price movements, and after all this what we need to win a binary trade. <br>
 <br>
Don&#039;t be intimidated by the charts, actually they are not that hard to read and understand. Strategies that are based on reading and analyzing charts are part of the technical analysis area.
        </p> buy apple shares. I bought some two months ago and my portfolio is up 40%. you should buy them after they report earnings next month, because I think they could correct a little bit after the recent huge rally. If apple shares ever dip below a p/e of 16, which they undoubtedly will, they are a huge buy.
        </p> I ha ve great business that is already perfoming, with $10k investment, your guaranteed a weekly profit of $400. My email is goodie_goody@hotmail*** write to me for more details if interested please.
