</script><p> Where you live is unimportant. The markets are global. <br>
 <br>
I seem to answer this same question over and over, but people just don&#039;t get it. <br>
 <br>
There is no &quot;best&quot; way, but hundreds of &quot;bests,&quot; and probably thousands. This is a fairly general and too broad of a question. <br>
 <br>
Within the mutual fund industry, there are hundreds of &quot;bests.&quot; <br>
 <br>
Within the ETF industry, again, hundreds. <br>
 <br>
Within the commodities sector, including debt instruments and derivatives, there must be thousands. <br>
 <br>
How many hundreds of bests are there in the banking industry, including CD&#039;s, savings accounts, T-Bills, etc. <br>
 <br>
How about real estate? <br>
 <br>
There is no one investment, there is no get rich quick scheme, there is no pot at the end of the rainbow.  <br>
 <br>
Like any vocation, it takes hard work, lots of study, and the testing of your theories, learning what makes you tick, learning your own particular time and stress levels, and fighting the emotions of fear, greed, and loss of hope. <br>
 <br>
Your success or failure lies within you, not some else&#039;s opinion. <br>
 <br>
One of the most important Samurai texts ever written, by Miyamoto Musashi, “The Book of the Five Rings (1643)”, offers this advice: “Think of what is right and true. Learn to see everything accurately. Become aware of what is not obvious. Be careful even in small matters. Do not do anything useless.” <br>
 <br>
There can be no great success in trading (life) without great commitment, hard work, discipline, and the realization of the “right” type of thinking. <br>
 <br>
It is the your attitudes, beliefs, and discipline that ultimately yield results. Courage and positive attitudes combined with sound market principles and methods will, in time, result in the desired outcome. Your persistence and determination to succeed is, in the final analysis, the critical element. <br>
 <br>
The best way to do anything yourself is to learn something about it first. You&#039;d be surprised at the thousands of books available on this one subject at your local library. <br>
 <br>
But most people spend more time deciding the color of their new car, than they do on a mutual fund advisor, for example.  <br>
 <br>
Are you really wanting to do this yourself, or are you asking about someone who is an expert who can do it for you? <br>
 <br>
If you invest in the stock market right now, or just buy into all the ETF&#039;s you can afford, it&#039;s a crap shoot, like rolling the dice, and the odds are probably not in your favor, whether you have an expert fund manager or not, because mutual funds are always &quot;in&quot; the market. <br>
 <br>
They say &quot;Buy and Hold&quot; for the long term is better, but that depends on when you get in, and what your definiton of &quot;long term&quot; is. The phrase &quot;Buy low and sell high&quot; infers that you buy after a decline; decidedly not the case here. <br>
 <br>
The Dow has approached all-time highs last seen in Jan 2000 and failed, so if your long-term definition is more than seven years, then you won&#039;t mind waiting another seven years for a profit. <br>
 <br>
In my opinion, the name of the game is capital preservation. When the risks are high, like right now, you get out of the stock and bond markets and park your cash in a interest bearing money market fund or CD or Treasury Bill. <br>
 <br>
This is simply not a good entry point for investors. Be patient, wait a few months, and you&#039;ll be able to buy much more stock a lot cheaper, the risks will be lower (even though they will seem higher), and your chance of success greater. <br>
 <br>
If you wish to research the “Buy and Hold Strategy” further, or perhaps trade yourself, I recommend two book titles. One is called &quot;Which Is Better, Buy-and-Hold or Market Timing?&quot; The other is &quot;Do You Have What It Takes to Be a Market Timer?&quot; They will give you plenty to think about.

        </p> I suggest investing in commodities options market. <br>
A good place to learn about such is this website: ***kenroberts***. It costs about $30/wk I believe, and you can learn online. You can be located anywhere and still trade. <br>
 <br>
Use some of the $1000 for the instruction, and some of it for actual trading, once you&#039;re ready. The returns can be great.
        </p> I suggest you to open a brokerage account at TD Ameritrade and invest in the United States of America Stock Market with the help of a Financial Advisor. <br>

Once you are done and it looks good. Sell it to an art gallery for $5000.
