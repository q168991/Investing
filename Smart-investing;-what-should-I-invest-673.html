<h1>Smart investing; what should I invest? ?</h1>
<div class="answer">I have some savings bonds, but with the risk of inflation I&amp;#39;m considering stocks gold ect........
I know gold does one think.... And that is rise in price, so that&amp;#39;s where I&amp;#39;m leaning. 
Here is my question; Gold, where do I start ? 
-where do I buy gold?
-am I able to by it by the 1/4 ounce or even less? 
-.999 other than a dealers/sellers word, how do I know it&amp;#39;s pure? 
-lastly and most important to me, where do I resell it to cash in and is it easy to cash in as far as finding a buyer/location.

gold testing kits on ebay, plus customer feedback and a non-moving website (legit businesses dont go anywhere for many years). Plus they will have a phone number and physical location which you can visit (showroom/shop). They will also have the exact name of the limited liability company that they trade under listed on the companies house website, this way you can tell who their directors(owners) are and you can get the police to track them down and arrest them for fraud if they try to screw you. If they do a runner and ever get stopped in a casual police search or get arrested for any crimes again they will be questioned about the fraud, so its not in their interests to deceive you. <br>
 <br>
Umicore bullion is usually real. You can research the company if you like, they melt down computer parts to extract gold and silver and other metals. They come wrapped up but if you like you can always unwrap it and test the metal, however this may devalue it as it could then scratch if not protected. Also people may then become suspicious of it. <br>
  <br>
Gold in non-ferrous, meaning its non-magnetic, so is silver. Silver tarnishes black easily in air after a long period of time. Get a powerful magnet, but beware tungsten is similar to gold and is used by scammers so it just being non-magnetic is not good enough. They only real way to tell is to slice the thing in half and see that the is no discoloration in the bar (all gold colored) but this destroys the bar and it then needs to be sold purely for its gold value. Another way is through melting. There should obviously be no discoloration of the metal. If it had crap in it you would see the other metal separate a little as you melt it to form a grey blob and a gold blob. <br>

 <br>
Ebay. Often gold goes for higher than spot price here.  <br>
 <br>
Kitco and thegoldbullionuk both offer a buy back service where they buy it back at the new spot price (making them soooooo great!) you can simply slip the bullion in the post in a inconspicuous envelope (unlike &quot;cash4gold&quot; companies that make sure your gold gets nabbed by postman!).  <br>
 <br>
Whether its easy to cash in depends how close you are to selling it at spot price compared to the competition.

</script><p> I&#039;d stick with physical gold and not ETFs. There are plenty of places to buy gold online. Some will delivery your gold to you and others will store it for you. You can also buy gold coins from local dealers. The smallest amount you can buy online is usually 1g. As for the gold being pure - you will need to do your research before you buy. Most reputable companies will be able to provide certification on the golds purity.
        </p> the elephant that got undercooked by the foot loose granny that smashed pink flamingos with water melons that arent quiet fully flamented. Also no one likes to flash their cash with their own granny bash. And as for the quarter inch pinch, id say the lily pad is a great place to hang your eye lobes after a hard days spectating.  <br>
If your under going confusing it is normal at this stage to think what the fu** and then jump inside the apple tree that isnt really there which seem unlikly but id rather snore than be sucked into the volcano in my bedroom. <br>
 <br>
Hope this tickled your underneath ideas
        </p> Gold mutual funds and ETFs are an easier way to invest in gold.  Start your due diligence by checking out this article, http://investorplace***/2011/04/gold-mu...  There are numerous other gold stocks/funds/ETFs as well.  Do your research before investing.
        </p> Gold does not ALWAYS rise. It has done in recent times, because of World economic troubles. If you do decide to gamble and buy physical gold, go for recognised coins, as these will be much easier to sell. <br>
