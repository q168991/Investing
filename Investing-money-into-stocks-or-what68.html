</script><p> you are going to invest $1000 and in 4 years you want money to buy a new car or a house???? Dream on.... <br>
 <br>
Let us say you happen to be a magician and doubled your money every year <br>
 <br>
Year 1 = $2000 <br>
Year 2 = $4000 <br>
year 3 = $8000 <br>
Year 4 = $16,000 <br>
 <br>
You might get a decent new car but nothing flashy....a long way from buying a house... <br>
 <br>
How about a more reasonable return of 10% compounded <br>
 <br>
Year 1 = $1100 <br>
Year 2 = $1210 <br>
year 3 = $1331 <br>
Year 4 = $1464 <br>
 <br>
not a bad 4 year return...no house, a junker for a car <br>
 <br>
Unless you gamble on a high risk stock (possibility of losing most of your investment 90% as you are not &quot;playing&quot; the investment (you don&#039;t know how in the first place)...your chances of turning that money into a fortune is very small.
        </p> Based on your question, you should not invest in stocks. The stock market isn&#039;t an ATM, and yes, you can lose money and lots of it. There is no way in the world you are going to have enough to buy even a used Yugo in four years based on a $1000 investment.
        </p> you only lose money if you sell for less than you bought and/or if the company goes under (GM and Washington Mutual). My best advice is to invest in a company you think will be around in 10 years- be it coca cola, walmart, pepsi, what have you. Kraft is a good investment right now because they are about to spinoff into a new company, Mondelez. This means that for every share of Kraft you own, you get a certain amount of free shares in the new spun-off company. To be fair, a thousand bucks might only buy you 25 shares of Kraft. And don&#039;t expect $1k put in the market today to return 20K by time you get out of the service. If you&#039;re lucky, you&#039;ll have $2500 sitting there when you get out.
        </p> cash is king. Cash or commodities. Avoid equities until the next big crash. Dont throw money into stocks right now they are bloated and over priced unless you are looking to do a dividend investment strategy.
        </p> You could gamble like put it something like a team winning a game or a futures bet. A lot people do stocks as well just do some research on whats hot right now and will most likely make you money.
        </p> Yep, you can lose money in stocks. Stocks and shares and forex are just a form of gambling with longer words.
        </p> Well with the economy right now it&#039;s best to invest ASAP
