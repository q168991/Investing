<h1>Who can I talk to about investing in the stock market?</h1>
<div class="answer">I have many questions about investing in the stock market. I&amp;#39;m 20 and have about $15,000 saved and want to invest all of it in the stock market. I know it&amp;#39;s risky but I&amp;#39;m young and want to take the risk, but I want to be smart about it and learn as much as I can about it before I do. And wouldn&amp;#39;t right now be smart to invest anyway since the stocks would be cheap and in the long run they pretty much have to go up? Any info/ advise greatly appreciated.

</script><p> Read.  Read a lot. Take your time. <br>
 <br>
You have two basic choices; <br>
A.   Buy Stock Mutual Funds <br>
B.   Buy individual stocks. <br>
 <br>
I generally believe that buying Stock Mutual Funds is a better idea for most.  Less time learning &amp; less time needed to follow your investment.  I do both (Stock Funds and individual stocks).  I started individual stocks a decade after doing Stock Mutual Funds.   <br>
 <br>
Start your reading with; <br>
Investing For Dummies <br>
Mutual Fund Investing For Dummies <br>
Stock Investing For Dummies <br>
 <br>
Then read some more books in the area you want to go first. <br>
 <br>
Remember always; <br>
A.  Don&#039;t put all your money into one single investment. <br>
B.  Stock investing for most requires a 5-10+ year time horizon. <br>
C.  Don&#039;t use stocks as your savings account.  Don&#039;t use money you&#039;ll need next month, next year or in the next five or more years. <br>
D.  Have an &quot;Emergency Fund&quot; in a savings account.  There is nothing worse than watching your stocks decline by 30% and have to cash them in for some &quot;unexpected&quot; emergency.  There will always be an &quot;unexpected&quot; emergency. Plan for it (that&#039;s what adults do).
