</script><p> I live in Asia, and we are always hearing of the good companies not just from my own country, but also in other countries, even in America.  Where we live in will affect our judgment on what makes a good stock market to invest in.  My investments are mainly in Singapore shares, because this is the stock market I am most familiar with. <br>
 <br>
However, if you are not in the Asian region, you will not understand or know very clearly what are the good companies that are worth investing.  There are some companies that provide very good investment value, either because they provide dividends on a consistent basis, or because they have good growth potential (Either linked to the emerging economies like China/India, or linked to growth industries like climate change related ones). <br>
 <br>
One advice I would give is if you are not sure whether Asia is a good place to invest in, start with a unit trust.  That will provide some form of diversification and help you see if ASia is a good place for investment.  Don&#039;t forget that diversification is a good principle to adopt in investment, so you should also think beyond your own country&#039;s stock market to beyond (regional or international). <br>
 <br>
As to the timing of when to enter, there is no best timing.  Of course you should avoid when the indices are too high.  But no one knows ... so dollar averaging may sound like a good concept to follow.
