</script><p> i do not totally agree with SSA because investing in a down market is the best type of investing. This is because stocks are selling at discount prices meaning that you can get very good stocks at low prices. But first you need to know how to look for discount prices and how to price stocks. You also have to know how to read financial documents and do research on the strength of the company. There are websites that teach this sort of thing but i am not allowed to post links coz am sort of new to yahoo answers. I recommend that you read investing books before getting into the market; it is a jungle out there and if you do not know what you are doing, you will get your eyes scratched out. no kidding
        </p> Stocks are quite popular among the urban investors. The stock will help the investor a lot. Before investing it is always good to have an expert’s advice. Stocks give the investor an upper hand. For more details about investment please log on to https://huroninvestments***/Contact_Us.html
        </p> It depends on the type of stock you invest in.  Some are low-risk and secure while others are the opposite.  You would first educate yourself on investing fundamentals and then seek professional advise.
        </p> well the stock market is pretty down right now... i mean its kind of like gambling if you are willing to take shot at it then go for it but if you dont have much money then i say you dont !
