</script><p> DRIPS stands for Dividend Re-Investment PlanS. Typically, some mutually funds are of this nature. $100, $200 is no money. Why fear. If you lose it all, that only a breakfast, a dinner and a movie. Even if it grows, you won&#039;t see it doubles until you are 50.

</script><p> Drips are an excellent approach for anybody your age. You&#039;re competent to speculate periodically with no commissions, and you accumulate a diversified portfolio of stable shares if you want to grow over time. Your portfolio will fluctuate up and down, however the lengthy-term development goes to be about 10 percentage progress per yr. If you happen to invest the same amount periodically, you&#039;ll be buck-cost averaging, which is an extra excellent aspect. Locate a list of shares that present drips and prefer a sort of industries in 8-10 with roughly equal buck amounts of every. You&#039;ve gotten a just right plan.
        </p> You may wish to consider 3M.  You can research the process at ***moneypaper*** or through Temper of the Times.  They also can provide a list of DRIP&#039;s that you can invest in very easily.
        </p> Get $3,000 or more then you can consider investing. <br>
Know that some brokerages require 3K to 5K just to open an account. <br>
And with your small amount you&#039;ll get hammered with fees. <br>
 <br>
= You are simply not ready yet.
        </p> When purchasing a stock for DRIP purposes, I want a quality company that offers its DRIP at little or no cost to me. I also want a history of dividend increases that are likely to continue, and a yield currently above the average for the Fortune 500. <br>
 <br>
Kimberly-Clark (KMB) is a paper goods and healthcare company which manufacturers and sells such ubiquitous brands as Kleenex, Huggies, Scott and Viva. In 2011, stated earnings were $3.99, but excluding special factors, 2011 earnings came to $4.80 per share. Management expects 2012 earnings from continuing operations of $5.00 to $5.15, and analysts generally agree with a mean prediction of $5.10 per share in 2012. <br>
 <br>
Kimberly-Clark has raised its dividend every year for 40 years in a row. Earlier in 2012 management raised the quarterly dividend from $0.70 per share to $0.74 per share, an effective annual yield of 4.1%. The company also has an ongoing share buyback plan, which will further support the stock in 2012 and beyond. <br>
 <br>
Kimberly-Clark has premier brands, a tremendous record of dividend growth, a generous payout, and plenty of room for future dividend increases. So, why isn&#039;t it a perfect stock for DRIP investors? How about a $10 start-up fee, a $5 fee for optional cash purchases, a $2.50 charge for an automatic recurring investment, and a typical $15 fee upon selling shares. I want and expect companies to offer set up and maintenance of their DRIP to be no cost. Kimberly-Clark charges almost every way it can. But at least it will reinvest dividend payments with no fee. Thanks, but no thanks. <br>
 <br>
Colgate Palmolive&#039;s (CL) 206 year history has developed it into a global company manufacturing and marketing everything from its namesake products to Hills animal products, Irish Spring and dozens of other brands. Its earnings have been quite healthy, coming in at an even $5.00 per share in 2011. Analysts anticipate growth to $5.39 per share in 2012, and $5.90 per share in 2013. Healthy business? Check. <br>
 <br>
Colgate has raised its dividend 48 years in a row, and the annual amount now stands at $0.58 per quarter, for an annual yield of 2.5%. Another dividend hike is likely with Colgate&#039;s next quarterly report this spring. Quality dividend history? Check. Room for dividend growth? Check. So, how about the company&#039;s DRIP? <br>
 <br>
Colgate boasts the worst DRIP I have ever seen. It charges for everything, even for reinvesting dividends. Specifically, it charges a $10 set up fee, a $1 fee for automated, recurring investments, a $2,50 charge for optional share purchases, and its aforementioned fee for dividend reinvestments is 5% of the amount, or $1,25, whichever is less. These amounts may seem nominal, but to me, it also seems a crummy way to treat business owners. I will not invest money in a company that treats shareholders like this, and urge you to share in my indignation. <br>
 <br>
Arch Coal (ACI) is a major domestic coal mining concern specializing in low sulfur and metallurgical coal, the latter used not for energy but rather for industrial applications such as steel making. Arch is not my favorite coal company overall, but its story right now is compelling. Under the weight of a more energy conscious domestic economy, coal sales have declined, and prices have fallen. The U.S. Energy Administration forecasts domestic coal production will fall about 50 million tons in 2012 from the already depressed 2011 level, as miners and producers respond to slackening coal demand. <br>
 <br>
As luck would have it, Arch expanded significantly in 2011 with its $3.4 billion purchase of International Coal. The purchase was paid with cash raised from debt and stock issuance. So now is not the best of times for Arch. But come on, under $12 per share? Arch is trading at its 52 week low, and its stock has fallen by about 70% since April, 2011. If there were ever a case of a company being oversold, Arch is it. Analysts see a whopping 80% of upside, to over $20 per share, for Arch in the next 12 months, and its five-year estimated PEG is a paltry 0.46, another sign of an oversold state. <br>
 <br>
Arch has raised its dividend seven times in the last eight years, and its current yield is 3.6%. I see Arch as a great opportunity for a risk tolerant investor, but make your investment outside of the company&#039;s DRIP. It charges $2.50 for automatic investments, and the same for optional cash purchases, and the same even to participate by reinvesting dividends. For smaller investors, those fees would wipe out the value of the dividend. Arch can, and should, do better.
