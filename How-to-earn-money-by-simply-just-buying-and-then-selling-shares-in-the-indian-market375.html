</script><p> There are no such things as &quot;shares in the ________ market&quot; no matter what the Country might be.  Corporate entities (businesses, investment groups) can sell shares in their business and if the business does well, those shares might increase in value. <br>
Oh; I forgot.  You need a significant amount of money to even get started in investing in the Stock Market.  Since your parents have said they want you to work, I seriously doubt that you ahve money, yourself, to put at risk.

</script><p> 24 Never Failing Rules 1. Amount of capital to use: divide your capital 20 equal parts and never risk more length of your capital on a one trade. 2. Use stop loss orders. 3. Never over trade. 4. Never let a profit run into loss. 5. Do not buck the trend. 6. When in doubt, get out. 7. Trade only in active stocks. 8. Distribute risk equally. 9. Trade at the best market. 10. Do not close your trade without good reason. 11. Accumulate a surplus. After you have made a series of successful trades, put some money into a surplus account to be used only in emergency or in time of panic. 12. Never buy a share to get a dividend. 13. Never average a loss, this is one of the worst mistakes a trader can do. 14. Avoid taking small profit and big losses. 15. Never cancel a stop loss order after you have placed it at the time you made a trade. 16. Avoid getting in and out of the market too often. 17. Be just as willing to sell short as you are buy. 18. Never buy a share because price is low. 19. Be careful about pyramiding at the wrong time. 20. Never change your position in the market without good reason. 21. Select the stock with small volume of shares outstanding to pyramid on the buying side, and the ones with largest volume of stocks outstanding to sell short. 22. Never hedge. If you are long of one stock and it starts to go down, do not sell another stock to hedge it .Get out of the market, take your loss and wait for another opportunity. 23. Avoid increasing your trading after a long period of profitable trades. 24. Never get out of the just because you lost patience or get into the market because you are anxious from waiting.
        </p> I think there is much more then just buying and selling shares in the market which can help you in earning returns in the share market. <br>
Since you are new to the market that instead of planning to invest you plan to learn about the market and search for it on the internet because it will improve your knowledge about the market. <br>
There is a lot of information available so visit mansukh, religare etc because it is always better to have knowledge before trying your luck in the market.
        </p> Buy at low price and sell at high price. <br>
It is a lot more difficult than that and most people lose more money than they earn, unless you go in for the long run. <br>
 <br>
Probably better to get a part time job and work to earn money.
        </p> &quot;buy low and sell dear&quot;,is the rule.concentrate only, on one or two scrips.initially invest only 1/10 th of the amount you have allocated.when the scrip/s&#039; price increases,sufficiently,say 10%, sell.when it goes down by 10% invest another 1/10 of your &quot;remaining&quot; capital to buy the &quot;same&quot; scrip/s.repeat the process. <br>
1.follow the market and the scrips&#039; trend. <br>
2.do &quot;paper&quot; investing( not actual investing,but only on paper) for a while to gain experience,to see whether your ideas work or not. <br>
