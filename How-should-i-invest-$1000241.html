</script><p> For a short time frame like a year, you&#039;re looking at perhaps 0.72% in  saving account or 1.72% in a CD.   Anything else would be as likely to result in a loss over a year. <br>
 <br>
Investing is for life, you accumulate when you are working and you disseminate when you are retired.   Anything else is a project and should be budgeted for separately.   You need to revise your concept of investments.

</script><p> Return on investment! <br>
 When you invest, you hope to get back more money than you put in. In other words, you want a good return on your investment. This is where Success Road to Wealth comes in. <br>
 What return will you get on your investments? <br>
 If you buy investments that pay interest, you often know what you’ll make. This includes savings accounts and Guaranteed Investment Certificates (GICs). <br>
 What you make depends on how long you invest, and how easy it is to get your money out when you need it. <br>
 <br>
 Most high-interest rate savings accounts with commercial banks are currently paying about 3% for the year. So if you put $1,000 in a savings account now, you would have $1,030 at the end of a year. You would make $30. Your rate of return would be 3%. Will that take you to your financial goal? <br>
 <br>
 If you buy other types of investments, such as stocks, your return may not be certain. There is a chance you could make nothing or even lose money. <br>
 <br>
 You don’t even know for sure what you’ll make, but now you will get an idea of what to expect. How? By turning your savings and investment to Success Road To Wealth can help you estimate the return you will get while you travel on the SUCCESS ROAD TO WEALTH.  <br>
