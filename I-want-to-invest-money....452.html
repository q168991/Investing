<h1>I want to invest money....?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am a 35 year old woman with a little extra money in the bank.  I really want to do something productive with it for my future like investing it.  Can anyone point me in right direction as I am pretty much clueless on the matter.

</script><p> Standard investment advice is that you should invest in a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and money market funds.  If you are like most people you will invest part of your money aggressively in stocks, and part conservatively in money market funds and bond funds. Vanguard has an on-line questionnaire which will give you an idea of how to do &quot;Asset Allocation,&quot; determining how much to put in each type of fund. <br>
  <br>
You want to buy a diversified portfolio of stocks as individual stocks are too risky. Highly knowleadgable people can buy a properly balanced portfolio, but most folks have a difficult time balancing things on their own. They will misbalance their portfolio by buying all small stocks or all growth stocks, or some other misbalanced assortment of stocks. Back in 2000, Some people bought all internet stocks; they got burnt when they all crashed together.   You have to diversify across industries.  Unless you know what you are doing, it is best to buy mutual funds. I like Vanguard***, other people like Fidelity, TIAA-CREF, and DFA. Buy no-load, low cost funds. <br>
 <br>
If your company offers a 401K plan at work, try to invest the most you can. The money grows tax free, and some companies will match your contribution. Investing in a mutual fund IRA is also a good idea. If you have children, you may want to consider a 529 plan or other college savings plan that grows tax free. <br>
 <br>
I like index funds. Because of their broad diversification, you are less likely to have a dramatic drop in value. They also have the lowest expenses. For stock funds, I would suggest putting ~70-80% of your money in the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund. and ~20-30% in a foreign stock index fund. However, there are many different opinions out there on what the best mutual funds are. Read the links below and form your own opinion. <br>
 <br>
If you have high-interest debt, like credit cards, it is best to pay this off first before trying most of the investment ideas above. You should also have 3-6 months of salary saved up as an emergency fund in a bank or money market fund before trying more risky investments.  <br>
 <br>
Believing advice you get on Yahoo answers can be risky, so read these websites for further information. If you find it too confusing, contact a professional financial advisor. They will charge you significant commissions, however.  <br>

Asset Allocation Calculators <br>

</script><p> You say you have a LITTLE extra money. That suggests that the security of your money is a priority. Investing in shares is a high risk investment strategy, and can result in you losing money. If you keep your money in savings accounts, or National Savings certificates, you can be sure that in a few years time your money will be worth more than it is now. <br>
 <br>
National Savings and Investments are always good because they&#039;re 100% guaranteed by the government. <br>
 <br>
However, they don&#039;t necessarily pay the best interest rates because high street banks like to be competitive. <br>
 <br>
There is another option that is safer than shares, and pays more than savings accounts. It&#039;s called Zopa, and I&#039;m sure it&#039;s just as safe as a savings account, too. Savings accounts work since you give money to the bank, and they pay you interest. The banks then lend your money out, and take a higher interest rate than they pay the savers. <br>
 <br>
Zopa is different - Zopa are a lending and borrowing exchange that lets you lend money directly to individuals with good credit ratings, cutting out the banks, and letting you keep all the interest! You get to choose your own interest rates (I&#039;m currently getting 7%-11%pa) and you choose the duration of the loan, and the credit worthiness of the individuals you lend to. If your criteria matches the criteria set by the borrowers, then the loan is made. <br>
 <br>
If you apply via this link: <br>
 <br>
http://***zopa***/member/The%20Hulk <br>
 <br>
you get an introductory offer of £30 if you lend more than £500! (This is a very good offer since £30 is 6% of £500, and you get paid that up front, and can then lend it out at higher rates.) <br>
 <br>
I&#039;ve been using Zopa since May 2007, and have had no problem with it so far. I&#039;ve had no bad debt, and I&#039;ve found the customer service to be very good. I would highly recommend it. <br>
 <br>
Have a look and see what you think!
        </p> There are many options available to you.  <br>
 <br>
Mutual Funds can be good investments, but you really have to know what you are doing. About 75% of them under perform the market, all of them have management fees, and some have sales loads.  <br>
 <br>
However, I did do my homework, and I am invested in 2 funds. I chose the Vangaurd family. <br>
 <br>
Another option is a DRIP Plan. I have had mine for many years, and it has performed better than any other investment I have. <br>
 <br>
DRIP&#039;s are seldom talked about because brokers make very little money when they suggest them. Yet, they have proven to be one of the best, if not the best, long-term strategy on Wall Street.  <br>
 <br>
They are perfect for small investors, as well as big investors. They are safe and allow you to not care about whether the market is going up or down.
        </p> If you don`t need the money at short notice there are high interest accounts, which means you can`t touch the money for 2, 5 or 10 years, the longer you leave it the higher the interest. The best thing you could do is make an appointment with an adviser in a bank or building society, we did this and he gave us quite a few options
        </p> I had the same problem as you have. <br>
I had a good amount of money, but didn&#039;t knew where to invest it. <br>
So I looked around for something that gave me a great return towards a low risk. <br>
And the only thing I could find was a mannaged account. <br>
Here you can follow up my results of every day: <br>

I&#039;m verry excited because I already have 47% ROI in one month and a half. <br>
My moneymannager is giving me great support, and answer all of my questions almost immediatly. <br>
Annyway feel free to contact me (adress on my blog) and I&#039;ll bring you in direct contact with my money mannager.
        </p> Your question requires no easy answer.  <br>
You should carefully research different investment vehicles and structure an optimal mix.  You are best left with a professional financial planner/advisor.  If you would like to have more information about some legitimate alternative investment opportunities I could give your some directions. <br>
You may freely send me an email or IM.
        </p> If you want a quick return on your money then trading in cfd,s is the way to go.  <br>
You dont actually buy shares as such but buy a contract on the assets.  <br>
You then earn or lose money on the opening and closing price of the asset.  <br>
Many people have got rich very quick from cfd&#039;s but there is also the risk of losing money quickly. <br>
Finding a broker will help as they can advice you on stops that sell when the  <br>
asset falls below a certain amount you can afford to lose. <br>

        </p> I´ve been investing for more than 20 years and trading for almost 14, and I can tell you that if you want to make BIG and FAST profits, I recommend you trading rather than investing, trading can help you to go from rags to rich.  <br>
If you are investing, you must have already achieved some degree of finalcial success, long term stock investing and FOREX can help you become much richer than you are today. <br>
My experiences as a Nasdaq Market Maker, Head trader of seveal brokerage firms, and currently as a professional trader and private hedge fund manager, I can sugest you that: <br>
 <br>
We trade because we want quick, short term profits on a consistent basis. We want to cash flow the market. Milk it like a cow. Make consistent, small, short term gains rather than trying to hit a home run on every trade. Don&#039;t ever forget that, don&#039;t marry a stock, marry the idea of making money trading stocks. That&#039;s the only way to do it.  <br>
 <br>
For me &quot;All stocks are equally worthless&quot; <br>
 <br>
I don&#039;t hold on to any illusion that the stock market will continue to go up and provide a nice retirement for me. <br>
I could care less which way the market goes. It&#039;s irrelevant to me if the market goes higher, crashes or moves sideways for the next 50 years. I really could care less. Stocks are just four letters with two prices next to them that I use to make a living trading.  <br>
 <br>
Trade ONLY when you have a clear, easy and identifiable advantage, because without a CLEAR EDGE your odds of success are NO better than a flip of a coin… That´s why so many new traders (and investors) lose money. <br>
 <br>
Take a look at any daily chart of any index or stock and you&#039;ll probably see the most volatility and the biggest opportunity for profit during the first Hour of the stock market&#039;s opening.  <br>
 <br>
The popular thinking and conventional wisdom is that you should wait about an hour before you start trading.  <br>
 <br>
But if you do, you&#039;ll miss the big, fast moves that stocks make as all the amateurs let their emotions out through their online accounts, usually right after they read some news headline or hear Maria Bartiromo go off about a stock on CNBC.  <br>
 <br>
It&#039;s easy to see why trading the open is the market&#039;s prime time for profiting from other online traders.  <br>
The market&#039;s open is very volatile - that is the perfect environment for LARGE, FAST profits.  <br>
 <br>
Learn to trade as a professional Market Maker ,not as an emotionally driven amateur trader or investor with few thousand dollars in an account at Etrade. <br>
 <br>
There isn&#039;t any other time during the day or any stock you can invest in, that can make you 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 or more points in minutes OTHER than during the first hour the stock market is open. That&#039;s why I love trading the open so much.  <br>
 <br>
I trade only when I have an edge and that means &quot;only the fisrt hour the market is open&quot;.  <br>
 <br>
If you are a beginning trader or investor, you can give yourself an unfair advantage in the market trading this way. <br>
 <br>
I can continue giving you a lot of advises about how to make money trading, but if you ask me: <br>
&quot;What is the best thing you can do for me or that I can do for myself?  <br>
