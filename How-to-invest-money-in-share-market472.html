</script><p> To Start Investing It takes a long time to learn the stock market and it would help if you read some books from your library and information online. Before you start investing in the market the first thing you need to decide is what risk level you want to take. CDs backed up by the government has about 3-4% annual return for the long term with a low risk. Bonds or Bonds Funds has about 5-7% annual return for the long term with a medium risk. Stocks or Stock Mutual Funds has about 8-10% annual return for the long term with a high risk and are more volatile than Bonds. A person could make more than 10% annual return with the right investment. Usually the more risk you take, the more return you will have, but not always. The stock market is basally made up of stocks and bonds. Investment managers pick a group of stocks to make a mutual fund or a group of bonds to make a bond fund. They even put a mixture of stocks and bonds together and call it a Growth &amp; Income Fund. 1- MUTUAL FUNDS: Mutual funds have a group of stocks (could be around 100+) invested in different sectors, and manage by a professional. Managers have lots of schooling for investing in stocks, around 8 years. So I think managers can pick stocks better than I can. You can make a buy or sell order anytime of the day for mutual funds shares but it will not go in affect until the close of the day. There are lots of different kinds of mutual funds that does not charge any fees to buy it&#039;s shares and they are called Noload Funds. There are also some funds called Load Funds that charge about 5% of your investment. Most funds has trading restriction and you may not be able to trade more than 4 times a year. That&#039;s because it makes it hard for the fund to make a good return if there is to much trading in the fund, causing the fund manager to make more buys and sells and keep more cash on hand. Mutual funds are meant for long term investors. 2- STOCKS: Stocks is more volatile than funds unless you spread you money in several different areas and know witch area will do best. There are 10 stock sectors and over 100 sub-sectors to choose from. Stock trading restriction is only a few days, not like mutual funds. If you own stocks, you will need to keep up with all the company&#039;s business so you don&#039;t get stuck with a bad stock. That could take a lots of time. If a person buys just a few stocks he probably is hoping to make a bigger return but he may be taking more risk. If that&#039;s the case, look at the leverage ETFs that represents a group of stocks. That could be another choice. 3- ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds): ETFs are like a mutual fund but trades like a stock and that is the main differences between ETFs and stocks and mutual funds. There are some ETFs that represents Index&#039;s. An Index is like S&amp;P or DOW. Index&#039;s operate just like a mutual fund with a group of stocks in deferent sectors, manage by professionals. You can&#039;t buy Index&#039;s because they are not for sell. A company owns them. But you can buy a mutual funds or an ETF that has the same stocks as the Index they represent. There are a lots of different kinds of ETFs for someone to choose from. There are some that represent almost every kind of sector. And there are some that have 1x leverage, some have 2x leverage for aggressive investors, and some has 3x leverage for more aggressive investors. To buy stocks or funds, you need a broker account. You can open an account online and it is free. You can find several good brokers that charge $8.00 and under per stock trade and no fee on Noload Funds. Most broker websites have good research tools. Some popular broker websites are Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, E-trade, Scottrade and others. I think you need a min. of $500 (some sites $2,500) to open a broker account and need to be at lease 18 years old. If you not 18, you might could get your Dad to open an account for you.
        </p> Definitely you can invest money in share market  for better and high returns. <br>
Stock markets provide high returns with high risks.  <br>
As you have no knowledge in Investing in Stock market and no broker will provide you any guidance on this. they just open trading account, demat account for you to trade in stock markt.  <br>
Best way to invest in stock market is , first you have to select one Technical Analyst for this , and subscribe for his services. <br>
 You should not try to invest in stocks which broker suggests you, or friends suggests.
        </p> how to invest money in share market:::::: <br>
first of all u need to understand what is share market and its basic things for this i am lending u basic info on this topic. <br>
 <br>
Share Market <br>
 <br>
Share Market is a place where everyone take bath in order to taste the money. But it purely depends on the fundamentals, luck, global cues, behavior of other country markets, currency rate, Forex rates, currency trading etc. Trading is done in terms of the shares. These shares are the name of the companies which gets listed, generally. Also the share price varies time to time even second by second, if the variation graph is critical. <br>
 <br>
Types Of Sectors <br>
 <br>
There are various sectors in the share market. Some of the known sectors are Oil, Reality meaning RealEstate, Construction, Finance, Telecommunication, Refineries, Steel, Broking firms, Food and beverages, Metals, Jewelery, Packing, Consumer Goods etc. The best sector to invest is the decision taken by the investors understanding the fundamentals of the company, turnover, volumes traded, balance sheet and so on. <br>
 <br>
Identify the Best Sector <br>
 <br>
As we saw above there are lot of sectors available in front of the investors. But which sector one should choose that will give good returns in short term and long term investments. If the economy is weak and the world is facing a financial pressure or crisis then it is tough to identify the sector as every sector would get affected. So it is better to pick up the mid cap stocks that will not go worse in near future. Because large cap stocks will plunge and surge drastically like anything. If you were caught at the peak say January 2009. then it is tough to get to that level. <br>
 <br>
How To Invest ??????? <br>
This is the first question a person asks himself and approaches others when he wants to invest in sharemarket. Basically you should have a clear vision when you want to reap the benefits that is the returns.  <br>
 <br>
If you want to pullout the invested money in short term, you should choose the critical moving sectors and shares and also don&#039;t act blindly on the third party suggestions. If you want to have the investment to be taken by your generation, then you can go for Long Term investment.  <br>
 <br>
In long term investment one should analyze the pure fundamentals of the company, the dividend amount it pays to the share holders,the capital and the percentage of share ratio between the company and the public. <br>
 <br>
Terms Of Investment <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Basically investors should go for two types of investments, short term and long term.  <br>
Short term investments are one that an investor will buy stocks and keep in his portfolio for at least 3-6 months. Gain must me kept in mind and thus the selection of stocks plays vital role here. Equity advisor consultancy is recommended. <br>
 <br>
Long term investments are one that an investor will buy stocks and keep in his portfolio for more than 6 months and for years. Here portfolio management is very important as many tax free income flashes the eye like Dividend, investment duration etc. <br>
 <br>
Share Trading Houses??? <br>

Generally shares are traded electronically today and these process is done through the brokerage houses and from exchanges like Bombay Stock Exchange BSE and National Stock Exchange NSE.  <br>
 <br>
Some of the well known brokerage houses are ICIC Direct, Reliance money, Sharekhan, HDFC Securities, India Infoline, Mangal Traders etc.  <br>
