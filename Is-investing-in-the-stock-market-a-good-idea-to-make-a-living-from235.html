</script><p> What you can do depends on how good you are. If you aren&#039;t good, then you are gambling- and that&#039;s luck. Given the hype and cons always around, it will probably be bad luck. If you can&#039;t do it well, don&#039;t do it.  <br>
 <br>
Complicated game- requires knowledge, skill, instinct- and money. To make a living doing it as an employee of an investment bank requires the skill to manipulate and grow other peoples money. To make a living as an individual investor requires you have your own money. You make that money in some fashion, start investing and make it grow. You leave all the gain in, so there will be more growing all the time. When you have $1000 and your investment doubles, you gain $1000. But when your investments are worth $100,000 and they double, things start moving fast.  The skill is knowing when and how to move your positions so that trend will continue- but you don&#039;t take any out until it&#039;s a large enough that is won&#039;t shrink when you do, or will keep growing. How long that takes depends mostly on the times (opportunities are always changing) and your skill. You will not take a small amount of money and create a cash flow of any consequence any time soon.  <br>
 <br>
I could now make a living from investing, but I have built portfolios worth 700K. The recession was an exceptional opportunity to multiply money, I have stocks that are worth 20 or more times what they cost me two years ago.  I still take nothing out, because my everyday source of income meets my modest needs. Others who started at the same time I did (10 years ago) with the same money (10K) but failed to make the right choices probably have about 10% as much gain to show for it.  <br>
 <br>
How you invest must match your ability and risk tolerance, as well as your nervous systems limits. Investing is unlike any other skill I know of, and I know many. Education and books get you started, but what really makes the difference in an average investor and a good one seems to come from how your mind works, almost like a genetic thing. Some are cut out for it, some are not. I&#039;m fortunate in that respect.  <br>
 <br>
I would suggest having an IRA  for an investing base to grow financially stronger, but not expecting it to be a source of disposable income.  For that- learn more valuable skills, or become a star performer in what you already know, thus be worth more money and probably get promoted. You would be surprised what a difference that alone can make in your value to an employer. Rare quality these days.

        </p> You can make great money of the stock market. It is DEFINITELY NOT all luck, although luck is nice to have. It doesn&#039;t seem like you have the time to manage your money, so if I were you I would think about putting some money into a S&amp;P 500 index fund. Index funds have low fees and preform with the market. Then put a little money into the GLD (that&#039;s its ticker symbol). It is a gold ETF that tracks the price of gold. Depending on how much you put in, in a few years you should be fat and happy. <br>
 <br>
I would wait for a little bit of a pullback before you buy the index fund. Gold has seen a nice pullback and may be offering a decent chance to get in. <br>
 <br>
I would use Scottrade to buy these two. Only $7 trades and good research tools.  <br>
 <br>
REMEMBER some funds require a minimum investment. Also when picking out a index fund make sure it preforms almost just like the index it&#039;s suppose to track. <br>

        </p> Investing &amp; trading are two different things.   Investing is for long periods of time.  I&#039;m going to assume you meant trading. <br>
 <br>
Swing or day trading can take 3-5 years to learn enough to be consistently profitable. It can take 3-5 years.  More than 95% fail at this pursuit. The balance earn a living and (for most) love it. It&#039;s not a 9-5 job.  There are many more hours put in.  The dollars earned are based on many factors.  But yes, you can earn enough to have a &quot;good&quot; life. <br>

 <br>
Here&#039;s some other books; <br>
http://joefahmy***/2010/03/17/recommend...
        </p> Only consider investing if you are prepared to lose money, investing requires a fair amount of knowledge.. <br>
It also helps to have a degree in a field relating to investing like finance, business, economics... <br>
I wouldn&#039;t discourage you from investing, but keep in mind that most hedge funds underperform the market. Also there is a considerable amount of risk that goes with trading securities, risk that a mother with children probably shouldn&#039;t take on unless she is moderately smart, moderately educated, and willing to do a fair amount of studying to leverage the application of knowledge of the financial markets to her benefit
        </p> Penny stocks are prone to violent fluctuation (volatility), many people believe that they&#039;ll luck out with a stock that will jump from $0.08 to $8 in two weeks. And it&#039;s happened. Learn here https://tr.im/pennystocktrading  <br>
 <br>
Scour enough investing message boards and you&#039;re sure to find success stories from investors who made a mint while &quot;playing the pennies.&quot; <br>
 <br>
Companies that can successfully make the jump from penny stock to power stock are rare, but when you find them they pay out in spades. Numbers vary quite a bit in the penny stock world, but investors have raked in gains over 1,000% in a couple weeks&#039; time. The real trick is finding the right stock.
        </p> No investing is too slow.  You have to buy food and pay for housing monthly.  Most pro traders make money trading futures and options both highly leveraged products.  You can daytrade stocks but will require $25,000 minimum in your brokerage account. <br>
 <br>
Same $25,000 with daytrading equity options but not with daytrading futures and commodities. <br>
 <br>
To make money, you have to take risks which means you will lose sometime and win sometime.  That means using risk capital that will not affect your lifestyle if you lose it all.
        </p> You can make money in binary options only if you treat it as a real form of investing. Learn here https://tr.im/QP3Xa <br>
 <br>
This means learning how it works, learning how to read charts and learning how you can make accurate predictions. All these are not that difficult but it takes some time. If you treat it as gambling and just make random predictions then you will obviously not win.

i have attended a lot of seminars, read counless books on forex trading and it all cost me thousands of dollars. the worst thing was i blew up my first account. after that i opened another account and the same thing happened again. i started to wonder why i couldn,t make any money in forex trading. at first i thought i knew everything about trading. finally i found that the main problem i have was i did not have the right mental in trading. as we know that psychology has great impact on our trading result. apart from psychology issue, there is another problem that we have to address. they are money management, market analysis, and entry/exit rules. to me money management is important in trading. i opened another account and start to trade profitably after i learnt from my past mistake. i don&#039;t trade emotionally anymore.  <br>
if you are serious about trading you need to address your weakness and try to fix it. no forex guru can make you Professional trader unless you want to learn from your mistake.
