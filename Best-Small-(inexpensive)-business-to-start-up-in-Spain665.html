<h1>Best Small (inexpensive) business to start up in Spain?</h1>
<div class="answer">Have a friend who set up an internet/calls cafe in Spain and has done quite well out of the tourists wanting to check emails and phone home..He set up with a very minimal start up due to the fact that he started off with few computers and built up as he made money..now he makes more monthly than what i can make here in the UK

My question is what other low-cost start up buisnesses would be good to start up in Spain?..would ideally like to start with something like an internet cafe (small set up costs) and with the gradual profit of that, eventually open up a bar/restaurant when I have more capital to invest.

would also like to point out that i have lived in Spain before and speak the language so please no points about &amp;quot;how hard it is to start a business in a new culture with new language etc&amp;quot;

Any Ideas?...Experiences?

</script><p> All business opportunities for English folk in Spain are the very,very long hours type.Restuarents,cafes,shops etc.Its very hard work and the returns are small due to not enough pedestrian traffic.If you want to work your butt of and have £10 in your pocket,do what all the other Brits do,or be sensible and invest in property in the south,buying and then renting or selling.Its simply not worth the effort for the traditional Brit businesses

</script><p> Hi there, <br>
 <br>
I&#039;m not sure whether you mean you want to run a business online or not but wondered if you wanted to take a look at this Work From Home business opportunity? It has been in operation for 14 years, run by 3 multimillionaires who are there all the time working with the community of business owners. I was pretty sceptical about it but sat and watched the LIVE Business working in action for a few days before giving it a go myself. I am pleasantly surprised that it is the ONLY online business that I have found where the bosses work alongside their members and the help and resources available are excellent, and absolutely FREE to members. <br>
I&#039;ve run a computer repair shop for 5 yrs previous to joining this opportunity and I know which one I prefer!! It doesn&#039;t matter what type of business you run (or any business at all for that matter) this company help you to make a regular positive income for many years to come. <br>
If you are not sure about it (scepticism is good in business!) just take a look and see what you think. If you log in, you can ask any questions to the live monitors and they will help and guide you to your answers. Dont worry about the form asking for your telephone number, this is only needed to contact you if you are having problems that cannot be resolved online. They DO NOT spam or cold call their members and they&#039;re the only professional online business that I have come across to date. The comprehensive training that they provide with the membership covers absolutely everything you could need to start the business and be successful. It is provided in a multitude of resources including reports, training manuals, video tutorials, live assistance etc, even a novice cant go wrong. <br>
 <br>
If you are serious about running your own business online I urge you to take a look, i&#039;m sure you will be surprised at what is on offer. i.e. 50,000 FREE visitors to the website of YOUR choice, just for attending a FREE LIVE Webcast from our CEO Dr J Lant. I&#039;m not going to list all the benefits just for looking, i&#039;ll let you take a look and make your own mind up. <br>
 <br>
Hope this helps you find something that works for you, <br>
 <br>
