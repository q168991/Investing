</script><p> My advice is save up 1000 and buy the Royce low priced fund. Symbol RYLPX. As one of the other posters stated this is an excellent small cap fund. <br>
Should you wish investigate an online broker which I do not recommend with smaller sums of money check out the second URL on selecting a broker.

</script><p> Not enough, no point in it. Get up $2,000 and then invest in stocks in the $7 to $20 range. If you invest in penny stocks its very risky, but more reward. If you invest in stocks that cost more than $20, it wont be worth it to you with only $2,000.  <br>
 <br>
$500 would only earn you money if you got into penny stocks, but they are so risky I would just avoid them if I were you or you could lose it all in a matter of a few days.  <br>
 <br>
If you just want to practice, you dont need any money, just pretend you&#039;re buying a stock, and watch the stock, and then pretend you&#039;re selling it, to see how well you&#039;d do.  <br>
 <br>
But I don&#039;t think its possible to make any money on stocks with only $500 invested. I think a minimum of $1500 or more is necessary.
        </p> Hi Dr. Chris, <br>
 <br>
For the most part Man is right about everything he said, I would only add that you could try trading forex which does not require a large amount of money to start with. They do offer a large amount of leverage, which can be a bit risky, but if you want to trade live financial instruments this might be the way to go. There is value in trading with real money over paper trading because nothing can replace the psychological battles that take place when trading with your hard earned money. This is the only way to learn to trade properly. Now, if you are looking to simply invest for a long period of time then you can basically just do your homework and find a good company with good fundamentals. This will tell you what to buy, and technicals will tell you when to buy. Good luck. I am a day trader so if you have any other questions you can email me. Chuckwheelan@yahoo***. Take care
        </p> Typically those investing in stocks invest a larger amount than what you have named here, such as a few thousand. Consider consulting a stock broker about the possibility of your investing this sum, and in the meantime learn as you can about the stock market.
        </p> Right now, Barrack Gold, and various mining companies.  Junior stocks are doing well right now, and I would place it in precious metals since you will have great opportunities for gain with 500.00.  Even if it goes down 30%, you will not lose much due to being a small investment.  However, you have much to gain if it goes up multiples.  Conservative bond/equity 50/50 monthly income funds are also good, but that would be good for someone who has 50,000+ which can get a couple hundred dollars a month in dividends, but someone with a small portfolio needs to make 50% gains and up, so precious metals which are known to be risky, but a good time right now would be the answer.
        </p> The stocks you want to focus on is consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and healthcare. These are DEFENSIVE stocks that will survive through good and bad times. Most of my positions are in these stocks. Some names include 3M, Procter &amp; Gamble, Kimberly Clark, Exxon Mobil, Walmart, Costco. Everybody&#039;s got to eat and wipe their butts regardless of the state of economy. Many of these companies survived through the Great Depression. <br>
 <br>
That&#039;s the benefits. You can sleep at night knowing your money is doing well. There are NO guarantees that you won&#039;t lose money. It&#039;s just that these stocks are the best. They pay good dividends too.
        </p> Try a small cap mutual fund.
