<h1>I have a question on investing money......?</h1>
<div class="answer">Ok i dont know how to explain this but i have 15 months left in the military and i want to keep the 8000 dollars i have now for when i get out so i wont be hurting.  i want to invest the 8000 in something for a year, i was thinking a CD but those really dont have good rates at all.  Does anybody know of anything i cant invest in for a year and get a good return on it.  By the way my bank is Navy Fed and USAA if that helps.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

Have at least 6 to 8 months worth of living expenses in a savings or cd account that you can break. <br>
You must have this buffer in case you can&#039;t find a job or have unexpected emergencies. <br>
I would go ahead and open that cd. <br>
These credit unions do not have as heavy penalties if you break the cd. <br>
And the ones you mention are the best - the very best. <br>
PenFed also has great cd rates. <br>
 <br>
Investing takes homework - lots of it. <br>
If you still want to invest go to your library or bookstore and get a book on Investing (find a simple one). <br>
Soak up all you can.  Then invest in the stock market. <br>
Find a discount broker like Charles Schwab or Fidelity Investments. <br>
 <br>
Do you have any loans, such as a car loan?  Pay it off so you won&#039;t have to worry about your car payment in case you can&#039;t land a job in this tough economy...

</script><p> Thanks for your service - we often forget that there are two wars going on and our men and women are at risk.  <br>
It is great that you will have no credit card or auto loan debt so you can start civilian life with  $8,000 on the plus side. Investing involves risk or it is not investing. There are no investments that will give you a &quot;good return&quot; without risking your investment. Also, investing is usually for a longer term than 1 year. Even if someone could identify a good investment (and they really can&#039;t) interest rates, the economy and world events can have significant effect on investments especially in the short term.  <br>
 <br>
I don&#039;t know what your situation will be when you get out but jobs are hard to find and you won&#039;t have your room and board etc paid by the military. So, you might want to consider making sure that $8,000 isn&#039;t at much risk, and in fact, try to add to it. Otherwise you could find when you get out that $8,000 that was invested is worth $6,000 and you don&#039;t have a job and then you could undo the no debt situation. <br>
 <br>
When savings rates are so low people are looking to get more return. That usually means they take more risk, even though sometimes they don&#039;t realize it. There are lots of companies that know this and create ads or products they play on this &quot;greed&quot;. When savings rates are low and the stock market (or real estate market, or gold etc) is good very conservative people decide to &quot;invest&quot;. Of course they usually invest just when the market is high and then they have a problem. <br>
 <br>
If you want the money in a year you should put it into savings even if the returns are low. That way the money you have will be there when you need it. After you adjust to civilian life, job, housing etc then you might consider investing some of your nest egg. For savings I suggest looking at Ally Bank or Discover Bank. They usually have the best of the low rates. Ally Bank has a no penalty CD that if you need the money you can get it without paying a penalty. Most CDs have a 3 or 6 month interest penalty if you cash in a CD early (Ally has a 2 month penalty on their regular CDs). <br>
 <br>
You might also look at what the military offers. Be careful to make sure your savings are insured by the FDIC or the similar government insurance for credit unions and that there will be no or low penalty for cashing it in early. Beware of ads or pitches that tempt you to buy something with much higher rates. There is almost always a catch. If safe rates are 1% there is no way there is a safe product that offers 3% without a catch. <br>
 <br>
Bsst of Luck and thanks again for your service
        </p> For eight months, I would open an account at http://***scottrade*** You can do most of it online but they have offices in most major cities. Then pick 3 or 4 blue chip stocks that pay good dividends. The stocks I am listing below all pay at least a 2% annual dividend (in the form of quarterly deposits into your brokerage account). That is twice what a CD pays. Yes, there is a chance the stocks will go down. There is also a chance the stocks will go up and you will end up with a nice return. <br>
 <br>
Here are the stocks I like: <br>
Coca Cola (symbol is KO) <br>
Microsoft (MSFT) <br>
Johnson and Johnson (JNJ) <br>
Altria (MO) <br>
Automatic Data Processing (ADP) <br>
 <br>
If you want to take a little risk, put $2,000 into a gold ETF (symbol GLD) or a gold mining stock like Agnico Eagle Mines (AEM) or Eldorado Gold (EGO). Some say that gold is on its way to $2,000 in the next 18 months so you could pick up on some of that.
        </p> 15 months isn&#039;t enough time to make anything worth the risk. There is no &quot;good return&quot; without risk, or without time. And in your case, you can&#039;t afford it.  <br>
 <br>
I assume you don&#039;t want to lose any, which is effectively zero tolerance to risk, so CD may be your only option. Even that, like you know, isn&#039;t worth your time. <br>
 <br>
I&#039;d just be happy I have $8,000 and keep it as it is.  <br>
 <br>
Since you are going to be working, you won&#039;t have time to watch or manage your investments, you shouldn&#039;t trust a person with your money and just sit back, that&#039;s the best way to lose your hard earned money.
        </p> You should either invest in silver or mutual fund which will give you good return
