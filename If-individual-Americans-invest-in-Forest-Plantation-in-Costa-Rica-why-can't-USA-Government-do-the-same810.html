<h1>If individual Americans invest in Forest Plantation in Costa Rica why can&#039;t USA Government do the same?</h1>
<div class="answer">Americans invest $100 per tree planted in Costa Rica for them to visit and harvest in the future. Investros ususally end up touring thier investment and proud of the forest that they have established. They have  option to harvest and turn trees into income. If this can be done by individuals maybe government has to review tax collections and make investments earn income.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> The USA government is too interested in politics to allow a simple solution as this to work. I think just the attraction of knowing you contributed to this would be worth the $100.  As the first answer provided it would need some oversight to be effective, to ensure a scam isn&#039;t being pulled.  GOOD QUESTION

The teak plantation scam has been around for many years. The trees are not planted, if they were, would take 100 years to mature, and poachers cut trees all the time. <br>
Stay away from this idea.
