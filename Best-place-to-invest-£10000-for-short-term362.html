</script><p> I´ve been investing for more than 20 years and trading for almost 14, and I can tell you that if you want to make BIG and FAST profits, I recommend you trading rather than investing, trading can help you to go from rags to rich. <br>
 <br>
If you are investing, you must have already achieved some degree of financial success, long term stock investing and/or FOREX can help you become much richer than you are today. <br>
 <br>
My experiences as a Nasdaq Market Maker, Head trader of brokerage firms, and currently as a professional trader <br>
and private hedge fund manager, I can suggest you that: <br>
 <br>
We trade because we want quick, short term profits on a consistent basis. We want to cash flow the market. Milk it like a cow. <br>
Make consistent, small, short term gains rather than trying to hit a home run on every trade. Don&#039;t ever forget that. <br>
Don&#039;t marry a stock, marry the idea of making money trading stocks. That&#039;s the only way to do it. <br>
 <br>
For me &quot;All stocks are equally worthless” <br>
 <br>
I don&#039;t hold on to any illusion that the stock market will continue to go up and provide a nice retirement for me. <br>
I could care less which way the market goes. It&#039;s irrelevant to me if the market goes higher, crashes or moves sideways for the next 50 years. I really could care less. Stocks are just four letters with two prices next to them that I use to make a living trading. <br>
 <br>
Trade ONLY when you have a clear, easy and identifiable advantage, because without a CLEAR EDGE your odds of success are NO better than a flip of a coin… That´s why so many new traders (and investors) lose money. <br>
 <br>
Take a look at any daily chart of any index or stock and you&#039;ll probably see the most volatility and the biggest opportunity for profit during the &quot;First Hour&quot; of the stock market&#039;s opening. <br>
 <br>
The popular thinking and conventional wisdom is that you should wait about an hour before you start trading. <br>
 <br>
But if you do, you&#039;ll miss the big, fast moves that stocks make as all the amateurs let their emotions out through their <br>
online accounts, usually right after they read some news headline or hear Maria Bartiromo go off about a stock on CNBC. <br>
 <br>
It&#039;s easy to see why trading the open is the market&#039;s prime time for profiting from other online traders. <br>
The market&#039;s open is very volatile - that is the perfect environment for LARGE, FAST profits. <br>
 <br>
Learn to trade as a professional Market Maker ,not as an emotionally driven amateur trader or investor with few thousand dollars in an account at Etrade. <br>
 <br>
There isn&#039;t any other time during the day or any stock you can invest in, that can make you 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 or more points <br>
in minutes OTHER than during the first hour the stock market is open. That&#039;s why I love trading the open so much. <br>
 <br>
I trade only when I have an edge and that means &quot;only the fisrt hour the market is open&quot;. <br>
 <br>
If you are a beginning trader, you can give yourself an unfair advantage in the market trading this way. <br>
 <br>
I can continue giving you a lot of advises about how to make money trading, but if you ask me: <br>
&quot;What is the best thing you can do for me or that I can do for myself? <br>
 <br>
Go to this &quot;Top Secret&quot; site and get the BEST stocks that will make the largest and fastest day trading profits you´ve ever seen... <br>
 <br>
***onehourtrading*** <br>
 <br>
After you review this site you won´t need a system, strategy, book, software or mentor to tell you what to do, <br>
you will be able to profit HUGE every day, picking your own stocks to trade. <br>
 <br>
Trade well, <br>
 <br>

What would be the best option for me if i want to invest 10000 for short term(1-3 months) in UK i see banks dont give much in return
        </p> Here you will find a step by step guide which will hopefully give you a better and deeper insight into how it is possible for you to make money from Binary Options trading https://tr.im/BinaryOptionsStrategy <br>
 <br>
You will first need to know what exactly Binary Options trading is, whilst this may seem like common sense many people just have a vague idea of what is involved and the exact risks attached to any trade, so make sure you fully understand the difference for example between actually buying a fixed asset and trading in Binary Options as the two could not be more different. <br>
 <br>
Next you will need to become something of an investigative journalist when you start trading in Binary Options and by this we mean you need to have a nose for a news story that is going to have a dramatic effect on whatever it is you intend to trade, and one way for you to do this is to keep fully abreast of all the daily financial news stories as this is the only way you are going to be able to make an informed decision on the movement of any Binary Options you are trading.
