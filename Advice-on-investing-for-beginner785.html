</script><p> Well very broad question here :)  <br>
But it&#039;s great to see you&#039;re interesting in learning about investing..  <br>
http://beginnersinvest.about***/od/typesofinvestments/Types_of_Investments_An_Explanation_of_Financial_Instruments.htm <br>
 <br>
The above link has a very comprehensive introduction to different types of investments, I would start there and delve into one of the specific types further that you&#039;re interested in.   <br>
Investing can be as simple or complicated as you make it, you could hire a financial advisor or use a company&#039;s investment program, alternatively you could go on your own and analyze investments for yourself.   <br>
  <br>
Once you determine what route you&#039;d like to take I&#039;d be happy to assist you in the next steps.
