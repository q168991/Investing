<h1>Should i read these 2 investing books (for dummies)?</h1>
<div class="answer">I already know a quite a bit about the stock market, but i want to start over, and i was wondering if i should buy these two books for starters:
Investing for Dummies
Stock Investing for dummies

And possibly later, mutual fund investing for dummies.

I was sondering if these books were worth my time?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> they are pretty basic.  i would say that you are ready for more in depth material.  personally i think that every new investor should read the rich dad series.  they are not how to books per se but they have great lessons on the mindset and philosophy of investing.

</script><p> I&#039;ve heard they&#039;re good - at least the &quot;Investing for Dummies&quot; one.  Haven&#039;t read them myself.  Stay away from the &quot;Rich Dad&quot; series like someone mentioned above.  They have a couple good ideas but many bad ones plus tax advice that could land you in jail. <br>
 <br>
Another good introductory book is &quot;Learn to Earn&quot; by Peter Lynch. <br>
 <br>
For slightly more advanced reading Peter Lynch&#039;s other two books are also good.  A little more advanced than that start reading Benjamin Graham.  
        </p> there are a wealth of investing books that you can read for free at your public library. so far, you&#039;ve discovered that you regard technical details as boring. well and good -- that pretty much rules out intermediate term trading as something you want to do. Graham [or the newer, revised version] is mostly about the fundamental issues that long term investors pay critical attention to. Maybe you&#039;ll find that boring and technical as well; maybe not. If you don&#039;t, then long term investing is much more likely to be your mode of operation -- at least as far as stocks are concerned. If you do find it boring and technical, then the next step is to look into visual chart reading -- which relates mostly to short term trading. *** No matter what you discover about yourself, I strongly recommend finding some area of investing that you actually like, if not love totally. Maybe that&#039;s rehabbing houses. Maybe it&#039;s looking at land use patterns and undeveloped real estate. Maybe its something else, too. Every field of investing has its experts -- professionals who make money regularly. Because they&#039;re highly interested, they&#039;ve invested countless hours learning everything they can -- and they use that learning to make their strong returns. It follows that the likely path to strong investment returns is through strong learning and you&#039;ll only do the learning if you like or love the material. *** And if you discover that you don&#039;t like or love investing at all -- well, maybe you&#039;re supposed to start your own business and run that instead.
        </p> I just bought the Stock Investing for Dummies.  I have only read part of it but it seems EXCELLENT.  My husband has been investing for years and has learned valuable new things in it that he didn&#039;t know before.  So I recommend it!
        </p> Go to the library and check out a lot of books on investing.  Some may not help, but some will. <br>

        </p> These books are great..... for the novice.  There&#039;s no way to judge your &quot;level&quot; by your question.
        </p> It depends on your level of knowledge.
