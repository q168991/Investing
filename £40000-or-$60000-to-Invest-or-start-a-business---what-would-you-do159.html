<h1>£40000 or $60000 to Invest or start a business - what would you do?</h1>
<div class="answer">I was thinking of the following
- Buy property in Miami, a lot of foreclosures there, maybe put down deposits on two apartments. I have calculated that each apartment will leave me with $1000 per month after expenses - if occupied.

- Buy shares - Rio tinto, Glaxo, Xstrata, Anglo American . . . but not sure I want to risk that much money in shares in case I lose it all.

- Start a business - I am not sure what sort of business I could start especially if it involves sales since most people will only buy food thesedays - recession etc

- Just keep it in the bank - not a good idea since interest rates are low.

- I would have bought property in the UK but buy to let requires 25% deposit for new homes and the mortgage rates don&amp;#39;t leave any income.

What would you do? How would you invest that much money?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Well, it depends on what kind of business you want to run - full time or part time, office, non-office. Since you did not indicate which type, I would suggest investing the money in several network marketing businesses. this way you will spread your risks and you can also run them from home. If you want to go down that road I can direct you to several good ones, but then it is up to you. You can also run a market stall selling whatver product you choose. Your local council will give you information on how to set this up. Happy investing
        </p> AIG was be a best stock to invest if you plan to invest for a long term, because AIG is too big to fail and beside AIG no longer need government bailout money. if you invest in AIG are now you returning profit is 10-30 times in 3-5 years.
