</script><p> Systematic monthly investment in index funds (iShares, Vanguard, etc) are the best and least risky investments if you are young or middle-aged, and therefore have a long-term investment horizon, such as 30 years (which all people, except those within 5 years of retirement, should have). This strategy is called “smart money” because it requires no thought and yet makes you automatically rich over time, based on historical market returns which no mutual fund manager can consistently beat, but which bank owner-voters, and related entrepreneurs, can beat. <br>
 <br>
As such, to become a bank owner-voter, and related entrepreneur (called the smartest of smart money), I suggest you join Strategic International Systems (a Yahoo Group) at the source below, having the following mission (but which requires no money): <br>
 <br>
1. To gather people into separate Group Web Sites of 65,000 Members (which group, tribe, or clan can span the globe), and thus enable each Group (or tribe) to make 256 Group Store Selections (of global franchise stores such as Wal-Mart, Coke, etc, within 5 miles of their home, wherever that may be). How? Using Yahoo Group Polls to make those Group Store Selections. <br>
 <br>
2. To use those 256 Group Store Selections to earn 3-25% free Sales Commissions (plus lower prices), in the hundreds of millions annually for each 65,000 Members (or tribe), on their Individual Product Purchases using today&#039;s free Store Key Cards (combined into 1 SIS Card). <br>
 <br>
3. To use those hundreds of millions in free Sales Commissions to invest in Marketable Securities (like Wal-Mart, Coke, etc) who&#039;s tens of millions in Investment Income can only be used to train each Purchasing Power Army to become the Marketing, Engineering, Science, and Administrative Workers needed to create their own Group Bank of 65,000 Members (again, spanning the globe of their tribe). <br>
 <br>
4. To use the resulting hundreds of billions in Business Loans from their “new” Group Bank to build an ultra-efficient-and-luxurious Neighborhood Design (anywhere, such as Orlando, FL, for tourists and your tribe), over 15 years, as described at ***VictoryCities*** (at 1/6 the size shown). <br>
 <br>
Why? Because executing this process will give each Member financial independence over a 30-year enlistment in SIS (or other such similar site); that is, as (1) 50%-controlling Bank Owner-Voters and (2) 50%-controlling Business Owner-Voters according to each Member&#039;s 1 of 12 Levels of Experience and Education (or Rank) as defined in the Enlistment Document.  <br>
 <br>
Note, all ranks are easily achieved, by anyone, as a result of online study and testing, but each Member must become what’s legally called a “sophisticated investor”, over time, in order to become a Bank &amp; Business Owner-Voter (and not just because the law requires it, but because it’s what the smartest of the smart money does). <br>
 <br>
Therefore, if each new Member, such as yourself, gathers 3 more new Members who each join SIS (or other similar such site) within a week (given your friendly encouragement), then your Purchasing Power Army of 65,000 Members (or tribe) will be created in just 10 weeks, and thus begin earning free Sales Commissions (plus lower prices) on your 256 Group Store Selections to begin the formation of your “new” Group Bank of 65,000 Members.  <br>
 <br>
Why? Because a Purchasing Power Army of 65,000 Members is inherently valuable to any and all sellers, worldwide, if those Members make 256 Group Store Selections, and therefore from whom no money is needed -- ever -- to make them financially independent over a 30 year enlistment in SIS (or other similar such site). <br>
 <br>
Many thanks, and may the power of trust and truth (or TNT) be within you...sincerely, <br>

</script><p> From my perspective, these best investments are ones you know something about and for which you have an investing plan that is realistic for your own situation. For example, I wouldn&#039;t invest in subject to&#039;s because I know nothing about them. I do invest in stock options, becasue I know how they work and how they fit into my financial goals. If you are interested in learning about stock options have a look at the site listed below.
