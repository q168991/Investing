</script><p> If you absolutely cannot afford to lose any of the investment, you&#039;ll want to look at risk-free investments.  These would include CDs (certificates of deposit) or money market funds.  Really, the highest-yield risk-free investments these days are high-yield savings or checking accounts.  The interest isn&#039;t great at the moment (2%, more or less), but you will never lose a dime in an FDIC-insured account.   <br>
 <br>
If this money is intended as the start of a retirement nest-egg, you might consider putting it to work in higher-yield investments like mutual funds.  This approach will expose you to risk, though, and you could lose money.  In the very long-run, a diversified portfolio of index funds of stocks and bonds is a great way to save for retirement, if you can tolerate the volatility.

</script><p> You should retain your money in a savings account and just forget about interest, your most significant objective will be to keep this money available to finance your education, and setting up your life after your education.  <br>
In this case, you were right the first time, 5000 is nothing in investment terms, but it can be a lot in terms of making good decisions on your life plan over the next few years. OUR STANDARD RULE IS do not invest money you will need to live on in the near term.

put the $5000 in a very high interest bank..and dont withdraw any cents within 2 years.

        </p> look for OTC US listed companies, they really give good returns. I started my investing career with these companies only, but make sure you choose the reputable ones such as OTC:GLAG.
