</script><p> eTrade has &quot;hidden fees&quot; like inactivity. Of the two Scottrade is the better choice on many levels. Both are mediocre brokers.... but Scottrade is (as I said)... the better of the two. <br>
 <br>
Picking a broker based on price or popularity is the wrong way to go about it. You should base it on what you need. You won&#039;t know what you need until you decide what type of investing/trading you&#039;ll be doing.   The best way to know this is to read a few books and get a feel for what you&#039;ll need. It would be sad to open an account with a broker &amp; want to do trailing stops or OCO orders and find out you can&#039;t do them.  Maybe you&#039;ll want to do a MOC order. Or some other type.  Maybe you need a good charting package on the platform. Maybe you&#039;ll need a software &quot;platform&quot; instead of a web based based platform. <br>
 <br>
Maybe you&#039;ll be better off just opening a Mutual Fund. Or a DRIP. <br>
 <br>
Good luck.

</script><p> My friend likes Scott Trade. <br>
He likes the fact he can drive down to the local office if he has a real problem. <br>
 If you have decided to invest your money into an account with an online broker, this article will help you in evaluating one. <br>
 <br>
Decide how you are going to use this account. Determine how much you are going to invest. Do you want to trade options, stocks or futures? Is service important to you? If you wish only to buy mutual funds perhaps you will be better served by going to a mutual fund company. <br>
 <br>
Do you feel more secure if the company also has an office near your home? <br>
 <br>
Where you have accounts now? Perhaps your 401K is with a large company such as Fidelity. Often they will offer you a better deal since you are an existing customer.
        </p> $2000 is not a lot to make a lot of trades, unless you heavily leverage it with margin. <br>
