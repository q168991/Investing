<h1>I&#039;m 18 turning 19 in July. I just started to get involved with investing in stocks.?</h1>
<div class="answer">I&amp;#39;m currently with share builder. I was wondering if it was possible to make $1000 in one day and if so, should I withdraw and keep the money or re-invest? How much stock would I need to buy in order to make that amount of money? What should I start out with? How should I approach such a business involving stocks? I though it would be a goody way to make extra money on the side if I&amp;#39;m careful because I know how some people lose thousands.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> The Stock Market is indeed a vey dangerous game of gain and loss. If you are not familiarized with the Market and intend to gain $1000.00 a day I deeply suggest you take it slow and do a vast amount of research on the prospective companies you intend to invest with. As a rule, I never invest more than half my capital. If invested wisely, which I prefer short-term, your investment should rise throughout the day: typically but not guaranteed. Once your money has doubled or the day has finished, place it in a mutual fund or some other account you prefer for storage. The next business day, reinvest up to half your new capital. Eventually you will be making over $1000.00 a day. This is not a secure or guaranteed system and should only be attempted by seasoned investors. If in the case you lose your entire investment for the day, you will still have half your capital stored away in safety and untouched. This way, you will be capable of reinvesting in order build up once again. I do not suggest you go out and jump knee deep into the Market, but DO YOUR RESEARCH. Follow up with businesses. Ask others how they invest. Learn. In time you will learn to recognize the waves of the Market and know when to invest or pull out. Be careful no matter which avenue you choose.
        </p> I think the first thing you need to do is eliminate get rich quick fantasies like making $1000/day. <br>
 <br>
If you only want to make money on the side, I would suggest dividend investing and reinvest the dividends so you have a second income in your 30&#039;s, but learn about it thoroughly first. <br>
 <br>
There&#039;s some good dividend books on Amazon, but you might also find these at bookstore if you browse the business section: <br>
 <br>
Not all stocks pay dividends, so check this using google or yahoo finance.
        </p> Trading stocks takes discipline and maturation. If it were as easy as eTrade commercials make it seem, than why would anyone bother keeping a day job. Stocks aren&#039;t for everyone, if you have an impulsive personality or lack patience, than I suggest improving yourself first because the market does and will change people&#039;s temperament and behavior for the worst.
        </p> I remember in highschool(1 year ago) they made us play a game on line( i forgot the website)but it involved buying and selling real up to date stocks and it was really cool because it showed you how ******* hard it is and how to learn from your mistakes about investing in who and what times to do it. Try googling the game if you can.
        </p> You need to start reading before you do anything with your cash. One book I liked a lot is Trade Your Way to Wealth by Bill Kraft. Why do you need to do it in one day? If you start day trading, the SEC requires you to keep $25000 in your account. Why don&#039;t you start by talking to a broker and taking some free, online investment tutorials. You have so much to learn.
        </p> My friend told me  his stocks have been like shoveling cash into a furnace evey month. <br>
