</script><p> Shares of stock is what you would buy and sell to make money. You do that through a stock broker. Or you can invest in mutual funds through a mutual fund family. You buy it at a price and sell it at a higher price or you sell short at price and buy it back at a lower price to be profitable. You need to position size through money management and not load the boat on one issue. And use stop losses for risk management. There is no guarantee you will make money. <br>
 <br>
You will have to develop your trade plan or system that tells you when to buy and when to sell. You can use company fundamentals or stock price technicals or a combination of both. Your broker should have some educational resources and stock scanning tools. Check those first and then sign up for free at moneyshow*** and place topics in the search box to get the links to those free videos and podcasts for you to watch and listen.  There is so much that you cannot learn everything in your lifetime.

</script><p> The stock market is basally made up of stocks and bonds. To start investing in the market you need to decide what risk level you want to take. For one of the safest place for your money would be something like CDs that&#039;s backed up by the government. It has about 3-4% annual return for the long term. Also on the long term, Bonds has about 5-7% annual return with a medium risk and Stocks has about 8-10% annual return with high risk. Usually the more risk you take, the more return you will have, but not always. To see the Return vs Risk go to:   http://i1223.photobucket***/albums/dd52...  <br>
When I started in the stock market, I just jumped in. I was loss at times but I learned as I went.  It would have been better if I would have read a book or something. I&#039;ve been in the stock market since 1986, 24 years and I started in mutual funds. It&#039;s a good way to start. Usually a mutual fund has a group of stocks, around 100+, invested in different sectors, manage by a professional, which makes it&#039;s shares a little safer than if you own a few stocks of different companies and don&#039;t know how to keep up with their business. There are lots of different kinds of mutual funds that does not charge any fees to buy it&#039;s shares and they are called Noload Funds. There are also some funds called Load Funds that charge up to 5% of your investment. Most funds have trading restricting, you may not be able to trade more than 4 times a year. With stocks, you can legally make a (Buy-Sell-Buy) trades within every 3-4 days, in a regular account. But it will take about 4-5 days to make a (Sell-Buy-Sell).  There is noting wrong with buying stocks but it does take more work to keep up with them and you should buy several different kinds to help protect your investment. For someone that doesn&#039;t have the time or the know how to pick good stocks, should buy mutual funds or bonds funds. Most broker websites sell mutual funds, bond funds, and stocks. You can find several good brokers that charge $8.00 and under, per stock trade and no fee on Noload Funds. Most broker websites have good research tools. Some popular broker websites are Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, E-trade, Scottrade and others.  I think you need a min. of $500 (some sites $2,000) to open a broker account.  <br>

 If you want to follow and learn from a retired individual that has 24 years of stock market experience, click my pic and read &quot;About Me&quot;.
        </p> I suggest visiting http://***fool*** and also reading The Motley Fool Investment Guide by David and Tom Gardner.  After you&#039;ve read that and read other investment books, try virtual trading first, on a place like Wall Street Survivor***.  During this time, be saving money to invest with. <br>
 <br>
Once you feel confident that you can choose good stocks from strong companies, then look at real-money brokers.  I use TD Ameritrade and Charles Schwab.
        </p> Hey there.  You don&#039;t need a broker anymore, with the advent of online shops such as Ameritrade, Scottrade, e-trade etc...  You will save a ton of money by doing it yourself. <br>
 <br>
It&#039;s all about buy low, sell high.  Sounds easy, but it isn&#039;t.  It can take years of experience.  You have to be at the right place at the right time.  I think the first step to being successful is self evaluation.  You need to have the emotional discipline combined with a proper trader skillset to make money.  Otherwise, your just gambling. <br>
