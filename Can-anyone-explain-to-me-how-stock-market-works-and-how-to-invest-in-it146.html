</script><p> I think the best way to learn about the stock market is to first see what the best traders are buying and selling and why.  This is the idea behind the site http://***top10traders*** - this is a free site that lets you create a portfolio of stocks with $100,000 in &quot;play&quot; money.  Each day the site ranks the best performing portfolios, so you can see how your picks perform compared to other investors.  You can also read posts on investing from the best traders, as well as share your own investing ideas.  There is also a charting feature , so you can see how your portfolio performs compared to the S&amp;P 500. <br>
 <br>
Here are this month&#039;s best traders: <br>

</script><p> The lines/bars on the graph represent the actual price of the stock you are looking at. On a 5 Minute chart, the line represents the price every 5 minutes. On a daily chart, each spot represents one day, etc. But if you have to ask a question that basic, you probably don&#039;t know what a stock actually is anyway.
        </p> Its too deep to understand in one shot. Put your money in top performing stock irrespective of price band and see your money grow at 20%
        </p> you need a mutual fund, an individual stock is too risky. <br>
buying stocks , you should have lots of money so you can buy different ones for diversification. <br>
Go to where they sell mutual funds and see what they recommend for your risk tolerance
        </p> I agree with  <br>

It is really very difficult to make you understood on yahoo. answer. better you take personal experience. Consult your local broker with help of some friend. Alternatively you can find some online brokers.
        </p> Open a brokerage account at TD Ameritrade.
