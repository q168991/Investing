<h1>Great books for investing?</h1>
<div class="answer">I&amp;#39;m completely new to investing but I&amp;#39;m really interested in becoming skilled at it. Do you recommend any really good books for beginners, that personally helped you a lot?

What would you say is a good approach to learning about investing? (ie. which books should I read first, and then which ones. etc.)

Thanks (and please only give advice based on personal experience.)<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> I have to say that without a doubt you have to read The Little Book That Builds Wealth by Pat Dorsey. Ive read many many books on investing over the years, but this is the most straightforward guide to beating the market. I guarantee you will not regret it.
