<h1>How Do I Invest In Stocks ? Should I Invest ? Apple Computer ?</h1>
<div class="answer">I Was wondering how do I get into investing stocks and if it is a good idea to start investing in Apple Computers since thier computers and ipod and even iphone has been so successfull.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> If I was starting out in investing I would buy ETF&#039;s (exchange traded funds). They offer the lowest fees overall and mimick the market or sectors of the market. Then, delve into individual companies finances, charts and potentials and learn the market in that manner. ETF&#039;s are great vehicles and can give you the best returns ...better than nearly 90% of all mutual funds that are professionally managed. That&#039;s the best advice I can give.

</script><p> Open a brokerage account (Scottrade, Schwab, etc.).  Then look up the symbol for the stock (I think yours is AAPL), and then click the &quot;trade&quot; button.  Subtract the amount of the commission from the amount you have available, then divide that by the price per share to determine how many shares you can buy.  Select a number of shares you are comfortable with (you don&#039;t have to shoot the whole wad on one stock at one time).  Then click the approval button.  You may get a message of your number of shares on the queue for orders placed.  Then when it goes through, you now own stock in your selected company.  It isn&#039;t hard.  The hard part is watching the price go down and you think &quot;I&#039;m losing money&quot;, but if you are &quot;investing&quot; it will certainly do that a lot, so you just wait.   You&#039;ll do fine.
        </p> It would have been an awesome stock to invest in ten years ago. Who knows what the future will hold with increasing competition from Windows (I became a Mac guy after dealing with Window 3.1/95/98 crap, Vista was the epitome of suckage, but Windows 7 actually seems decent now) plus Android and Blackberry for mobile phones and tablets.
        </p> I used tradeking, about a year ago, I bought 10 shares of apple for $74, each. It went up to about 86 a week later and dropped until the summer when it hit about $50. When it got around the mid $60&#039;s I got scared it would drop again and dumped my stock. It didn&#039;t really do anything until recently when it went to something like $97. In my opinion, its a bad time to buy, because the stock shoots up after the January Macworld expo, and then tapers off for awhile.
        </p> first of all do a lot of research before investing. AAPL is in trouble right now on TWO fronts their first was a second quarter earnings report and the second is the future of Steve Jobs himself. AAPL is a flat out DO NOT BUY until the smoke clears.  <br>
 <br>
In fact I&#039;m not holding on to my tech etf too much longer either. (planned sale but holding off until Vista hits).
        </p> Mutuals the best and safest- to invest and to forget about. Everyone in town will give you advise- stocks go up and down- but a mutual fund is spread out- sure winner. Can retire as millionaire.

        </p> It looks like apple is doing something right.  <br>
 <br>
But that alone does not predict how the apple stock will perform.
        </p> 1) Open a brokerage account. <br>
2) Yes. <br>
3) Yes. <br>
 <br>
The Apple IPhone is not a sucessful product yet. <br>
The FCC has not approved the product yet.
        </p> I would recommend you to check the website below where you can find more details on Shares and Stock market and how to select best stocks.   <br>
Hope it helps, <br>
