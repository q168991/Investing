 <br>
Before you spend $0.01 on any investment, you must know what you’re doing, why you’re doing it and how to do it.  Before you invest in any security, the first investment you should make is in yourself, and the best investment you can make is by educating yourself.  <br>
 <br>
Begin your education by learning why you should invest and the importance of being able to make your own decisions or how the pro’s make theirs. Start your education by reading “Investing or Dummies” by Eric Tyson. <br>
To continue your education select some of the following  <br>
Beating the Street by Peter Lynch <br>
Bulls Make Money, Bears Make Money, Pigs Get Slaughtered, by Gallea <br>
From Riches to Rags, by I.C. Freeley <br>
Millionaire Traders, Lein &amp; Schlosberg <br>
How to Make Money in Stocks” by William O’Neil <br>
24 Essential Lessons for Investment Success by William O’Neil <br>
The Intelligent Investor, by Benjamin Graham <br>
Common Stocks, Uncommon Profits, by Philip A. Fisher <br>
One Up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch <br>
Stocks for the Long Run, by Jeremy Siegel <br>
Uncover the Secret Hiding Places of Stock Market Profits by Joel Greenblatt. <br>
What Works on Wall Street by James O&#039;Shaunessey <br>
You Can Be a Stock Market Genius by Joel Greenblatt <br>

 <br>
Websites that can provide instructions and help with procedures and terminology are Investopedia - http://***investopedia***/ http://***investorshub***/  and 1 Source for Stocks - http://***1source4stocks***/info/stock... or Smart Money  <br>
http://***smartmoney***/ <br>
Visit some of the more professional websites like  Zacks Research - http://***zacks***/ Schaeffer’s http://***schaeffersresearch***/ Investors Business Daily - http://***investors***/default.htm?fromad=1   <br>
Some of these web sites will have advertisers who are worth looking into also. And remember, if they offer free information, get it.   <br>
 <br>
Attend all the free seminars you can, just be careful and don’t get pressured into anything you really don’t want or need. Most schools offer courses in finance and economics, but very few will have courses on the mechanics of the investment markets, if they do try taking the course. You may want to consider on-line courses, the New York Institute of Finance use to have such courses. Try to get some fee information from The stocks exchanges they all have (had) free booklets, SIAC and some of the regulators (FINRA SEC MSRB CBOE) may provide some free literature. <br>
 <br>
And when you think you want to invest/trade, try some paper trading to test your skills without spending you money http://simulatorinvestopedia***/   http://***moneyworks4me***/  <br>
and/or http://***tradingsimulation***/  <br>
 <br>
You at least have made the right decision to start investing, this is the first big step and it won’t be your last. Keep taking those steps forward and along the way never take the advice from people that are not in the market or try to tell you not to invest. <br>
 <br>
Good luck on journey, study hard and you’ll invest well.

</script><p> First, until you mum or dad cosign an account for you, you wont be doing any investing until you are 18. There&#039;s no convenient wayto get money rapid; and it&#039;s not so convenient to get to 1,000,000 in a number of years. I matters you need a couple of more years to realize how the arena works. If I were you; i would use one of the vital internet sites outthere that permits you to crate a fictional portfolio and mess with that for a 12 months or two earlier than you set your possess money in. And my personal advice; use your money to have a excellent time. There is plently of time to acculuating wealth opening for your late 20&#039;s. You wont get back your high tuition and tuition years, so use your money to subsidize the nice occasions.
        </p> There are something like 10000 books on Amazon about stock investing.  I suggest you start out reading some of those.  Peter Lynch&#039;s books are simple and good places to start.
        </p> Skip individual stocks and mutual funds and look at ETF&#039;s (electronically traded funds), they give you the advantages of stocks with the diversity of mutual funds.  You can look at yahoo finance under the ETF tab for more information. <br>
 <br>
You can invest in sectors ie; healthcare XLV, utilities XLU, energy XLE, retail XRT, industrials XLI, materials XLB, consumer staples XLP, consumer discretionary XLY, and technology XLK.  The ones mentioned above are the big ones. buy low and sell high. use stops and targets. the three letters are the call letters.   these ETF&#039;s are the most active enter them in yahoo finance in the &quot;quotes&quot; box to get more information on these call letters.  Educate yourself as much as possible about the economy, world events, human behavior and the stock market. <br>
 <br>
Buy when you don&#039;t want to and sell when you don&#039;t want to. The thought process should be similar to a sale at a store but with stocks your mind works just the opposite. Your mind and emotions tell you to buy high and sell low. It takes a while (sometimes years)to get the correct mindset.  Open an account at any online broker.  Most of them have simulation accounts, the ultimate video game since it can score in real money.  You will have to learn the platform thru their on line tutorials. <br>
 <br>
Good luck and don&#039;t give up!!
        </p> Start reading Warren Buffet. <br>
 <br>
Start Reading Ben Graham. <br>
 <br>
Then, get started investing!
        </p> I would avoid dealing in stocks until you are a few years older.  If it really is of interest to you then learn about it in preparation.  Things you should learn about include: <br>
 <br>
- Fundamental analysis <br>
- Technical Analysis <br>
- Trading psychology <br>
 <br>
If you can gain an overall understanding of each of these aspects then that will stand you in good stead. <br>
 <br>
Also, ask your parents if they will open a demo account for you with one of the top brokers.  With a demo trading account you can place trades with play money, view charts, data and much more. <br>
 <br>
Good luck learning the trade!
