<h1>What is the most useful way of investing money?</h1>
<div class="answer">I want to invest some money but i don&amp;#39;t have the idea.
I am afraid to invest money in stock.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

 <br>
For average people like you and me, the best way of investing money are... <br>
1. Work <br>
2. Save <br>
3. Do your own (small) business <br>
 <br>
Why? Working generates the most return in a year. Let&#039;s say you need $500 a month to say alive and your salary is $2500 a month, that means your return is 500%. No stock investment can give you that much return in a month. Besides, you will be promoted in the future so that means your month income will increase. Invest in your own personal education and training to be more professional to earn more income. <br>
Then you save. Live below your means. The more you save, the more you have in the future. Save your money in the bank or trust funds that can help you to fight off inflation and income tax. <br>
Lastly, if you want, do your own business and be your own boss.

</script><p> I would diversify!  Don&#039;t put all your money in one nest!  Investment opportunities include stock, bonds, and IRAs.  You need to initially pay yourself by placing a portion of your weekly paycheck into a regular saving account with your bank or credit union.  You may want to speak with an investment counselor that can also show you the different investment opportunities available, although always think about your options (and do your homework) on the many different investment opportunities out there!  Be wery of scam artitsts....always a good idea to check out an investment firm with your local better business bureau!  I hope that this advice helps you.  Good luck in your endeavors!
        </p> I think the best way to learn about the stock market is to see what the best traders are buying and selling.  Read their investing thoughts.  This is the idea behind the site http://***top10traders*** - this is a free site that lets you create a portfolio of stocks with $100,000 in &quot;play&quot; money.  Each day the site ranks the best performing portfolios, so you can see how your picks perform compared to other investors.  You can also read posts on investing from the best traders, as well as share your own investing ideas. <br>

        </p> Hi you might not like my answer, if you keen to know please read on. The best Investment is “Invest In Yourself”.  You might think what the crap answer is that…… <br>
  <br>
In reality, that is what 90 % of what rich people do. They learn from the expert, whether it is real estate, finance, Internet, marketing etc. We live in the world of Copycat.   <br>
 <br>
Why you wan to try the hard way, whereas there is someone already succeed in the particular field you interested.  Just ask and learn from them…but off course it takes time, money and effort…   <br>
 <br>
You might ask, which business should I go to?  The answer is again very simple “Do What You Love”. <br>
 <br>
Then again, you will ask, how do i know what I love to do?  There is 1 way to find out, are you ready for the answer….that is   <br>
 <br>
“You willing to do something even though it is for FREE”  <br>
 <br>
If you interest is in real estate business.  Start with investing yourself by attending Seminar by Top Real Estate GURU. If you keen on internet business, do the same thing….and on and on…. <br>
 <br>
You will surprise how fast you will achieve your goal….The Guru has already help you to cut down your obstacle. The GURU has been there and knows which strategy work and which didn’t.  <br>
 <br>
For me my interest is in internet Business. So I invest a lot in myself learning from Top internet guru Derek Gehl, Alex Mandossian, Armand Morin…. <br>
 <br>

        </p> invest in government bonds. i wud say stock is the best, high risk=high profits too. but if u r afraid invest in bonds, the US government bond has the highest credit ratin(AAA) which means this is vertually risk free. but the drawback is that it has a very low coupon (interest rate) as its low risk.

         x you buy a jar of 60 for $100 and sell them for  $10 a piece
        </p> Bonds are a safe investment...
        </p> Real estate.  History has proven that you will make money if you do it carefully.  It has the least amount of risk with the most amount of gain.
