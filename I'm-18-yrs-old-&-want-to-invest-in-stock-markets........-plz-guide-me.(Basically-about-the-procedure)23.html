</script><p> Open Demat and trading account with an approved stock broker.  Demat account is required both for investment in IPO and Secondary market.   In India Income Tax Permanent Number (PAN) is compulsory for opening of these type of account.  In my opinion, you have to go for long term investment and investment through SIP (Systematic Investment Plan) is the best option.   <br>
 <br>
While selecting the stock, give careful attention to well managed and consisting divident paying companies.  Do not select penny stock which are cheap and not traded and  those which are suspended by stock exchanges.

This site helped me a lot in understanding how stocks and the stock market works. You can also buy/sell stocks with &quot;play money&quot; so that you have a basic understanding of how stock market works. <br>

        </p> Your best bet is to contact a financial planner.  They will meet with you for free (If they say they charge for their time then they&#039;re no good anyway so don&#039;t take the appointment).  They will be able to explain everything to you.  The best way to find one to talk to is to ask people you consider to be financially secure right now if they have one.  If they answer no, then they aren&#039;t as financially fit as you thought.  Get 3 names and start calling them. <br>
 <br>
I coach people all the time that we all need to use our resources.  At 18 if you get a financial planner on your team you will be far ahead of other people. <br>

        </p> Start with an IRA to get your feet wet.  You can open one up at ***ingdirect***, which bought out ShareBuilder.  Buy no-load mutual funds.  Mutual funds are great because they diversify your investments, rather than putting all your eggs in one basket.  Also diverify your money between mutual funds (tech, international, large companies, etc...)
        </p> Start out with mutual funds. Never invest more than you can afford to lose. [The site below on &quot;how to beat the IRS&quot; may be helpful.]
        </p> great explanation by anand v. thanks a lot man for such a wonderful explanation. can u just make it more clear by expaling wht is the meaning of Pe,PEG, book value etc terms that are used in stock market, any site where i can get meaning of all terms of stock market
        </p> First practice - before you risk real money. Try a site like xearn*** that lets you create a virtual portfolio for free.
        </p> f you watch any news channel or listen to any of your colleagues talking you would have invariably heard the term &quot;Shares&quot;. The term shares used here refers to &quot;Equity Shares&quot;. &quot;Equity Shares&quot; are the most common types of shares and are the most widely traded stock market instruments. <br>
 <br>
&quot;Equity&quot; means ownership. Anyone who holds one share of XYZ company owns a portion of the company. <br>
 <br>
How are Equity Shares formed? <br>
 <br>
Any company that satisfies the conditions laid down by SEBI (Securities and Exchange Board of India) can issue equity shares. SEBI is the governing body for all market related instruments in India. <br>
 <br>
Let us say XYZ company wants to go public. (Going public is the word used in market terminology to refer to the event of a company issuing equity shares for the first time) It would file an application with SEBI. If it is filing a request to raise a capital of say Rs. 1 crore, it would be issuing 10 Lac equity shares of face value 10 each. <br>
 <br>
The terms Face value and Market value would be used through this article. Let us first understand what they are. <br>
 <br>
Face Value - The Face Value of the share refers to the intrinsic value of a share. This is the value at which the company issues its shares to the common public. <br>
 <br>
Market Value - Once a share is issued to the public, it would be bought and sold through recognized exchanges like the NSE or BSE. The price at which a particular share is being bought /sold is termed as Market Value. <br>
 <br>
Net capital Raised by the company = 1,00,00,000/- <br>
No. of Shares issued through the public offering = 10,00,000 (Out of these 10 lac shares, the company would be holding at least 51% that is 5,10,000 shares with itself. The remaining 4,90,000 shares would be available for the public) <br>
 <br>
When XYZ files its application, based on the profit making capability, its revenue etc the company and SEBI would decide on the market value at which the share would be available for the public to buy. Say for e.g., the share with the face value of Rs. 10/- could be available at the price of Rs. 50/- for purchase through the public offering. <br>
 <br>
Net Amount raised by the company through the public offering = 4,90,000 * 50 = Rs. 2,45,00,000/- <br>

 <br>
A Stock market is one where Shares/Stocks are being traded.  <br>
 <br>
Reg. buying stocks:  <br>
 <br>
first you need to come up with an asset allocation pattern. i.e., you need to decide in which segment of companies you would like to invest more. based on the asset allocation, then you need to shortlist the best possible companies that are trading at attractive valuations and the go ahead with buying them.  <br>
 <br>
For eg. a sample asset allocation could be Equity - 70% &amp; Debt - 30%  <br>
This asset allocation for equity &amp; debt should be in such a way that the % in debt should be your age and the % in equity should be 100 minus your age. For eg. if your age is 25 then equity should be 75 and debt should be 25%  <br>
 <br>
Equity Split up: (for the 75% that you are going to invest in Equity)  <br>
FMCG - 20% <br>
Pharma - 25%  <br>
Automobiles - 10% <br>
Banking - 15% etc...  <br>
 <br>
Debt split up: (For the remaining 25%)  <br>
 <br>
Bank FD - 50% <br>
NSC - 25% <br>
PPF = 25%  <br>
 <br>
As of now concentrate only on large caps (i.e., large companies) They are the ones that have been able to survive the test of time and be profitable for years. and they would be the first to recover once the market starts to pick up.  <br>
 <br>
All the best. Happy investing.  <br>
 <br>
Cheers, <br>
