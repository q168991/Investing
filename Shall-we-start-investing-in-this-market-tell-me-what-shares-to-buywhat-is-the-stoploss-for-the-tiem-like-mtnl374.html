</script><p> No offense to the person whom answered previously regarding not investing in single stocks but investing in money markets and mutual funds but this information is seriously flawed. <br>
If you are investing in steel, you are likely aware of the significant problems this industry has faced over the last several years.  Given this and the current economic cycle, steel could again face problems.  For this reason, if you are investing in individual sectors, you might want to consider buying a basket of stocks.  STQ is a good example - Phily exchange 15 stocks. <br>
If you have a balanced portfolio, individual stocks is NOT like gambling.  Gambling is statistically a neutral event, yet returns for equity markets (individual stocks) are skewed to the right and thus have a positive return.  Investing in individual stocks, after doing homework, can lead to a strong portfolio if you are good at selecting investments.  But this is not for everyone and using a broker to &quot;help&quot; is not a good guarantee.  Start first with what you know, understand the financials, listen to company conference calls, and talk with the investor relations people. <br>
Now regarding levels, backstops, et al... <br>
I would suggest using Bigcharts***.  Read a few books on charting -- it does have some validity to the subject but weigh the charts with the backdrop of the current economic conditions. For example, this explains the recent sell-off.  Ask yourself, what is the short interest in these stocks!  Use differant methods can often yld differant results with technicals (as can fundamentals).  But you have to do the work here. <br>
For starters: drawing a line at the ~340 would provide a support resistance line that has been tested a few times.  Recently this was tested and held.   However, be aware that it did break a major uptrend that began in ~10/05 and continues to be declining.  IMHO, the 340 is likely to be a significant lvl. <br>
As to the last point of the other person&#039;s comment.  Sorry to say, but Money Markets are not alternative investments to stocks.  Stocks are long-term while Money markets are short-term.

</script><p> Never buy single stocks, that is, stocks in a single company. There is no difference between single stocks and gambling. Invest in mutual funds or money markets. They have averaged 10% + over the last 70 years with much less risk than traditional stocks.
        </p> Do you know from where BSE has started moving up. It was at 2700 3 years ago and peaked at 12000. <br>
 <br>
So think twice before jumping in. <br>
