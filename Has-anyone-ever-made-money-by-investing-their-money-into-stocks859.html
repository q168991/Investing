</script><p> I haven&#039;t made a lot, but I have made some.  Risk relates directly to gain/loss.  Similar to gambling, the greater the risk then the more you might lose or gain.  I don&#039;t take high risk so I don&#039;t make money fast.  In contrast, I do make more than I lose because I am more aware of what is growing.

</script><p> I got started with individual stocks by investing small amounts in Microsoft, starting in 1989.  I would buy about 1 year before MS would release a new operating system, &amp; sell it on the day they released it.  I did this a couple times &amp; made some good money.  (If I had only bought alot in 1989 &amp; let it ride, I would have made much more money.) <br>
 <br>
As the tech boom accelerated in the 1990&#039;s I ended up with alot of money invested in Microsoft and Intel.  I sold it all in late 1998.  I made a ton of money, but would have made more if I had waited 1 more year.  But what the heck!  I was happy with my choice then &amp; still happy now. <br>
 <br>
Then I started buying back Microsoft in mid 2000, after it had dropped in price alot.  I bought too soon, as it continued to drop.  I bought more as it dropped.  Buy prices: $35.3, $28.6, and $22.5.  Yesterday MSFT crossed above $35 a share.  It took seven years, but I got my money back on my worst purchase, plus the other pieces I bought at cheaper prices now have big gains. <br>
 <br>
I&#039;ve invested in many other stocks over the last 2 years &amp; have made moderately more than I have lost. <br>
 <br>
I have learned two lessons.  In an incredibly strong bull market like the late 1990&#039;s you can practically throw a dart at a list of tech and internet stocks &amp; make alot of money, IF ... you sell before the collapse.  Otherwise, you do need to know what you are doing. <br>
 <br>
How do you learn?  I&#039;d start by reading books on value investing, including those by or about Ben Graham and Warren Buffett.  Also read some Peter Lynch. <br>
 <br>
Then if you are still interested, try reading books by the momentum investors like William O&#039;Neill &amp; Jim Cramer and the material in the &quot;Investor&#039;s Business Daily&quot; newspaper.  I don&#039;t really advocate this stuff but these guys can make a ton of money.  I believe about 50% of the market operates according to these types of rules, so you should know how these folks think.
        </p> The best way to invest in stocks and make more money than any other investment is to invest in mutual funds.  If you are looking to make &#039;a lot of money&#039;- guess what?  That&#039;s right you will not make any.  The  stock market is not a gambling casino.  Investing in stocks should be investing thought of as investing our economy.  Systematically (monthly) add money to a mutual fund account and you will prosper.  Visit my site ***themutualfundhelper*** and I will help you  get started.
        </p> I have made some money with stocks but I have lost a lot more than I have made. In order to make money with individual stocks you have to know much more than the average person can know. Your best bet for investment is to find a good index fund or two and stay with them. In this way, you will make money over the long term. Also, ETFs are a good way to go now. Vanguard and iShares have many good ETFs.
        </p> Money can be made through stocks and their derivatives (more risky, potentially higher returns).  <br>
If you cannot afford the time to educate yourself in stock valuation though better go where smarter money goes -  statistics of daily transactions can be easily found.  <br>
If you cannot afford this effort, stick to ETFs, where risk and gain are at relatively moderate levels. <br>
Personal experience remarks: do&#039;s - do learn (a definite must), do invest, be calm, be patient; dont&#039;s: be cocky.
        </p> Don&#039;t worry about price per share. 100 shares of a $5 stock or 10 shares of a $50 stock is still $500 and if they go up 10% then you&#039;ve made $50 profit on either. &quot;Cheap&quot; should be considered relative to potential. Paying $50 for a stock is cheap if it&#039;s a growing company on it&#039;s way to $90. Paying $5 for a stock is expensive if it&#039;s on it&#039;s wat to $1.
        </p> I am 15 years old and I have been stock trading for over two years but have only recently begun trading actively at the begining of October. Since the 8th I have made over $2,500 on just an intial capital of $3,200 thats 70%! My strategy is to select the hottest IPO&#039;s and ride their hype. If a 15 year old can make it big, anyone can!
        </p> A few months ago I bought call options on EMC at $55 a contract. Three months later each contract went to $330. I sold at $310.  <br>
I made money in Game Stop and Intuitive Surgical
        </p> To get started in stocks, you will need a few things: <br>
-a few spare hours a week to read the business news <br>
-a willingness to learn as much a you can about the stock market and the different types of transactions <br>
-about $10k for starters <br>
 <br>
If you lack any of these things, you would be better off with a mutual fund/index fund.
