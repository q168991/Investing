 <br>
1) Fundamental analysis ( economic data, business model, economy, geopolitical, conpetition) tells you WHAT TO BUY <br>

</script><p> Definitely accounting since it teaches you how to handle money and how to read financial reports. In addition an accounting degree is also heavy on finance courses. It doesn&#039;t hurt that accounting students get the highest salaries upon graduation than any other business student. More money to invest.
        </p> Accounting, Economics and Finance are all good, but, in my honest opinion...none of them will teach you squat about how to invest.  <br>
 <br>
I believe you have to learn that on your own. Listen to what Jim Cramer has to say, read his book, read Investing for Dummy&#039;s, check out Motley Fool, Morningstar, MSN Finance, Yahoo Finance. Read everything you can.
        </p> Economics
        </p> Economics and finance and as much knowledge as possible of the business world.  <br>
 <br>
ie. in addition to your studies, start reading WSJ everyday as well as some other periodicals, newsletters.
        </p> Econimics..........:P..
