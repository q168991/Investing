</script><p> I get the feeling that you are very young, teen age perhaps. Your question suggests that you want a lot of money with not too much effort, and it should be a nice business that will make people think you were pretty smart to discover it. And you hope to get this information for free from some stranger in an internet forum. Well, I am taking your question in a broader aspect, namely &quot;How to get rich.&quot; I, a stranger, am going to tell you a proven method for getting rich, and you can have this information free for nothing. I&#039;m pretty sure you can&#039;t do it. Your youth will stop you. I&#039;ll explain that at the end of my essay. <br>
 <br>
First you need a job, but not just any job. It has to be in a field that has been stable for a very long time, such as gardening, janitor, laundry, like that. Something basic. If you want to start your own business, that&#039;s ok. You really want a job that you can walk to, or your customers come to you, so that cuts out most of the construction jobs and big company stuff. That way you don&#039;t have to spend a lot of money keeping your wheels running, because you don&#039;t need to own wheels. You rent a cheap pad or stay in your mother&#039;s basement or something. Since you live so cheaply, you are able to save most of your income. You spend your evenings at the local library studying economics and investments. As you learn more from your studies you can move into investments, always choosing the highest quality and safest offerings.  <br>
 <br>
That&#039;s it. That is the entire method. Does it work? Assume you are making $10 an hour, $20,000 a year. If you save half your income for fifty years, you will have half a million dollars in savings, not counting interest, dividends, or paper profits. A half million bux of principle. That sounds close enough to being rich for me. Other people have done it, but it&#039;s so unusual that they get their names in the news when they retire. There was a story in 2001 about a lady in Alabama who retired, gave $160,000 to a college for a scholarship fund, bought a house, and settled down to enjoy her remaining days in comfort. She started at age 15, washing and ironing sheets by hand. That&#039;s all she did for fifty years. I heard of a fellow who immigrated to the USA in the late twenties. He never held any job other than soda jerk in a drug store. (A soda jerk made milk shakes and ice cream treats.) He never owned a car, never married, and he lived the whole time in a flat above the drug store where he worked. He spent most of his off time at the library and only bought the highest quality stocks, one share at a time at the start. When he died in the fifties he left an estate valued at $200,000 which would be about four million in today&#039;s dollars. One of the better known examples was a fellow named Andrew Carnegie. He worked five years, saving his wages for an investment. Then he put it all into a steel business. Maybe you&#039;ve heard the name. His hobby was building libraries and concert halls. <br>
 <br>
You might be starting to understand why I said you probably can&#039;t do this. The loudest message a young person gets from this is, &quot;NO FUN!&quot; A young person wants to boogie, and that&#039;s expensive. That is the biggest reason so few people ever get rich by their own efforts.  <br>
 <br>
It&#039;s your decision. Good luck.

        </p> How To Make 1 Million Dollars
        </p> Hmmm, I&#039;m getting that you need to invest $2,205.37 a month at 6% per annum effective interest for those 20 years to get $1,000,000.   Regardless, the process is to be consistent over those 20 years.   There&#039;s no skipping on a payment, no catching up later.   Unless you want to take the chance of it taking 40 years instead of 20, you will invest more conservatively than you would like to.
        </p> you can make a million dollars starting with $20,000.00 in 20 years , but it&#039;s very possible to do it in 10 years or less . <br>
 <br>
take for example buying a stock like apple 10 years ago or gold 10 years ago , not that hard except you need great patience , and that is rarer than gold in this world .
        </p> just put what you can afford to put into some mutual funds.preferably a few of them.if you let them there for twenty years they should make you a lot of money.but your probably not gonna make a million unless you already have  lots of money to start with.(like $250,000 or more).but start with a few large cap funds and put what you can in them.
        </p> You would need to save $2164.31 monthly for twenty years at 6% interest.
