<h1>Where is best place to invest in silver/gold?</h1>
<div class="answer">I want to start investing in silver mainly and possibly gold. I have no idea what to buy or where to buy it from.

I live in the UK , does anyone know how this sort of thing works?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Open an international trading account with RBS. Buy SLV (Silver ETF) or GLD (Gold ETF) for US trading £20 per trade. They are listed in US market. They are not shares but ETF commodities are traded like shares. I reckon that you might see gold price at $1450-1470 soon where you buy/enter and leave for 3-5 years.

 <br>
Penny stocks, also known as cent stocks in some countries, are common shares of small public companies that trade at low prices per share.  <br>
I&#039;ve been subscribing to this PennyStock web site for about a year now and have loved the objective advice they give. He really does look for quality stocks and I&#039;ve made some pretty nice profits on a lot of his suggestions. Being still fairly new to investing I have been dabbling a lot in penny stocks to try and grow my account. I may not have a big account, but it&#039;s a lot bigger than it was a year ago. On just one of Nathan&#039;s picks this year I managed to make my investment back ten-fold! Be careful! Penny stocks are notoriously risky but if you follow the right method the risk is almost 0. I suggest to invest only little money first and then reinvest the profits. This is the site I&#039;m using: http://pennystocks.toptips.org
        </p> As almost everything is digital nowadays, there&#039;s no one place that is best to invest, you have to use your knowledge and always be updated on world news. Nowadays, silver has given way to gold as a popular investment tool. Only a few governments buy/sell silver instruments today, and much of the trading is done on exchanges. there are two ways to invest in silver or gold, one is to go on specialized commodities exchanges, particularly silver and gold exchanges, and buy silver or gold shares, without, and this depends on the person, the convenience/inconvenience of having to handle the physical investment. <br>
 <br>
The second way is to find persons, or organizations (particularly governments, as they&#039;re more reliable) who buy and sell silver/gold instruments. however, as i said, only a few governments recognize silver instruments anymore, i think switzerland still does, however, for gold, there are plenty of options available. gold bullion coins marketed by national governments abound in the open market, the most popular ones are the South African krugerrand, but there&#039;s also the Canadian maple leaf, Australian gold nugget, United States eagle and many more, these are recognized as currency by their respective governments, and as such, people will buy them, and often at above its premium bullion value, be warned however, as with all currency, counterfeits abound. there&#039;s also the mythical gold bars that you could buy, however, they&#039;re much rarer, but they&#039;re almost immune to counterfeits.
        </p> http://***goldline.co.uk/ <br>
Check out this link, you can buy from here, either bullion coins or bars, so depending on how much you wish to spend, you have a good choice. It&#039;s probably a good idea to have a mixture, so in the future if you need a small amount of money, you can sell a few coins to get it. This firm has been dealing for years and is very well known in the trade. You can also keep an eye on the price.
        </p> Penny stocks are loosely categorized companies with share prices of below $5 and with market caps of under $200 million. They are sometimes referred to as &quot;the slot machines of the equity market&quot; because of the money involved. There may be a good place for penny stocks in the portfolio of an experienced, advanced investor, however, if you follow this guide you will learn the most efficient strategies https://tr.im/fb19f
        </p> I talk about spontaneous investing for next week. If you are adventure taker, go to Silver. If you need more secured but slower investing, go to gold
        </p> I have been trading over 32 years using over a hundred different systems, but as you might guess only few of them showed consistent profits. This is one of them https://tr.im/XxDxw  <br>
What&#039;s most important is that they really cares about his fellow traders. Every time I have a question he is here for me, and he replies to emails really fast.
        </p> Get prices and check with your banker or a large brokerage that deals with precious  metals. <br>
Hold the metal or coins in a safe, or bank  deposit box .
        </p> Look for South African precious metals brokers.  They usually give the best deals and are most knowledgeable on precious metals.
