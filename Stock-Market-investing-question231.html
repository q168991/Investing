<h1>Stock Market investing question?</h1>
<div class="answer">I&amp;#39;m interested in investing in the stock market nothing major just some side cash and had a few basic questions I would like help with.

I was wondered what would be a good amount of money someone would want to have to start investing?

Maybe some common mistakes people make while investing someone would want to avoid, as well as maybe helpful advice for someone starting?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Everyone has a different version of what a &quot;good amount&quot; is. Make sure you have enough in savings in case things go south for at least 6 months. As to minimum to invest, it depends on where you go. Schwab allows you to invest with as little as $100 if you contribute in every month. For others like Vanguard for many funds they need at least $3000.  <br>
 Some of the best are Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, and Schwab. Avoid the big banks like the plague. Don&#039;t let them rip you off with loads (sales charges) and fees. Check how much the company charges you as an expense ratio. A good one might charge you 0.2-0.8 %. If they charge more than 1% than go somewhere else. And if they charge any kind of 12b-1 fee, hold on to your wallet and RUN. <br>
 <br>
But some basic generic advice is: <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Have a goal - know what you are investing for, and choose the right investment to achieve it. <br>
 <br>
Choose the right amount of risk - neither too cautious nor too reckless. <br>
 <br>
Do your research - choose what&#039;s right for you - not someone else, especially a sales rep. <br>
 <br>
Be diversified and allocate your investments properly.  <br>
 <br>
Thank long term and avoid the Big Money Fast hype. <br>
 <br>
Don&#039;t invest according to emotion - especially fear/panic. <br>
 <br>
Don&#039;t just look at the investment - consider fees/taxes/commissions around it. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
.... Especially with the first question, remember if you ask 5 people what to do, you will probably get <br>
double that in suggestions. But what might be right for you might not for someone else, and vice-versa. Different people have different goals. Is it for more income? For retirement? For someone&#039;s education? Plus how old are you and how long do you want to invest? How much risk are you willing to assume? <br>
 For stocks typically you are talking about at least a 5 year investment period. If less, consider getting into bonds or a bond fund instead. <br>
If you want to get into the market but don&#039;t know what stock to pick, I would choose an index fund or ETFs. Instead of throwing all your eggs into one basket (one company), index funds can invest you in dozens, hundreds, or thousands of companies all at once and so there is less risk. This protects you if any one company or industry runs into trouble. For bonds, the returns are less, but more solid. <br>
 <br>
If you are thinking of retirement, consider a Roth IRA. Your money grows tax free, and when you retire you can withdraw it tax free as well. <br>
 <br>
Getting individual stocks make more sense if you really want to buy stock at a place you work at, or want to really get involved and are the hands-on investor type. If you want to be more passive and have things grow over time, index funds make more sense. If you want to see some of the variety out there, <br>
For more information, try looking at <br>
https://personal.vanguard***/us/funds/v... <br>
and play with it, comparing funds with more or less risk. <br>
 <br>
Do some reading online such as  <br>
http://***vanguard***/us/insights <br>
and books like Investing for Dummies, or The Complete Idiot&#039;s Guide to Investing for a good intro.

</script><p> You should try with Penny Stocks Trading (you can find more info here: http://pennystocks.toptips.org ) <br>
 <br>
Penny stocks, also known as cent stocks in some countries, are common shares of small public companies that trade at low prices per share.  <br>
I&#039;ve been subscribing to this PennyStock web site for about a year now and have loved the objective advice they give. He really does look for quality stocks and I&#039;ve made some pretty nice profits on a lot of his suggestions. Being still fairly new to investing I have been dabbling a lot in penny stocks to try and grow my account. I may not have a big account, but it&#039;s a lot bigger than it was a year ago. On just one of Nathan&#039;s picks this year I managed to make my investment back ten-fold! Be careful! Penny stocks are notoriously risky but if you follow the right method the risk is almost 0. I suggest to invest only little money first and then reinvest the profits. This is the site I&#039;m using: http://pennystocks.toptips.org
        </p> Learn before you burn.  <br>
 <br>
Go to Yahoo finance and set up a portfolio.  From that try your various strategies.  Set up different portfolios based on your different strategies.  Investing clubs are fun.  It gets other people involved and you learn from each other.  When you are ready, start out with a safe and solid option, for example a Vanguard ETF or mutual fund.  Next, try a stock.  When one of your portfolios goes bad, figure out why it went bad.  When it does well, figure that out.  A year from now, what do you think the economy will be like.  Will the Obama plan get more people back to work, why does employment effect the stock market?  Why does the tsunami in Japan effect the stock market?  Why does us bombing Libya effect the stock market?
        </p> Here is a very handy site for first time investors: <br>

 <br>
Like them, I suggest that you get your feet wet with a Mutual Fund. This lets a professional money manager take your small investment and diversify it over a number of stocks. You share the risk with others in the fund. If one of the stocks takes a nose dive, you have the others to protect you. This is very hard to do starting out if you are investing in the market on your own. <br>
 <br>
The biggest single mistake people make starting out IMHO is investing money that they can&#039;t afford to lose. (I&#039;m talking about shares of stocks here, not mutual funds) <br>
 <br>
The second biggest mistake is selling your stock when it takes a hit.
        </p> If you’re new to investing, going it alone can be risky if you don’t know what to look for in a stock. Even savvy investors use our research to build their portfolio because they know it gives them the highest return for the investment with the least amount of “out of pocket” time for them <br>
 <br>
This basic guide may help you : <br>
First of all you have to decide whether you want a full-service stock broker, or an online discount broker for trading. There are advantages and disadvantages to both. Full-service brokers are far more expensive, but will pretty much take care of your investment for you. Discount brokers will give you much more control, you&#039;ll be able to choose when to buy or sell and what to buy or sell. Discount brokers are cheaper, but for the inexperienced trader far more risky. <br>
 <br>
Next up you&#039;ll have to find a broker which fits your needs. ING Direct has Share-Builder, with extremely affordable $4 stock trades and no account minimum. Scottrade has a ton of free tools and services with their service, and $7 stock trades. TD Ameritrade gives free advice and independent research along with a ton of tools to use. There are so many brokers to choose from, just look around for a while and choose the one that best suits what you&#039;d like. Try searching for &quot;Stock Brokers&quot; on Google and clicking the paid ads to see some of the popular stock brokers <br>
 <br>
Lastly, all you have to do is trade stocks. Use the tools and advice given to you by your stock brokers, buy low, sell high! Good luck!
        </p> Don&#039;t know too much but- The minimum amount you can invest is $500 (In Australia anyway), and to start off, you should probably invest in a bank or something, because mining companies can drop really easy (eg, BP after the oil spill) so they&#039;re higher risk, for higher reward, but you&#039;d be better of making a low risk investment to start off.
        </p> you have to look at your budget and how much you can afford to risk. Since you are new in trading I&#039;d say don&#039;t invest too much money in the beginning. See how much you could afford to loose and then trade with this budget. After a while you get a better feeling for this and only then do I suggest you trading with more money.  <br>
Good luck!
