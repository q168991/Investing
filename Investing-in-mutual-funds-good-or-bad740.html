        </p> 1
        </p> The only people who think mutual funds are bad, are paid financial advisors that earn commissions from the sales of stocks and bonds. There are very few individual investors who should be buying stocks or bonds. Instead, look at mutual funds with low management fees - less than 0.5% per year. Or consider EFTs instead. Look at the index funds first - index funds model a particular stock market index, and are run by computer. This keeps the cost very low, and also avoids emotional decisions that will not always match market sentiment. Over the long haul (10 plus years) an index funds is highly likely to match the market; whereas with individual stock picks, you will almost certainly make less than the market. Look at Vanguard, Fidelity, or T Rowe Price mutual fund families - these are good starting points. Vanguard have several highly rated funds, with some of the lowest management fees in the industry. On your specifics: Most mutual funds have a management fee which is typically less than 1% per year. You want to find funds that are below 0.5%, otherwise these higher management fees will eat away your profits. Some funds have front- or end-loads. These are fees you have to pay to get in to, or out of, the fund. DO NOT buy a fund with either a front- or end- load. These are simply not good value. Buying stocks are subject to a cost per trade. If you trade in a large number of stocks, the costs for buying and selling will become prohibitive. Financial Advisors either charge an hourly rate, or a percentage of your holdings. First, I don&#039;t believe anyone really needs a financial advisor; read all you can, and learn to make your own decisions - you are the one most interested in your financial success. If you do decide to hire one, make sure they are NOT paid on any kind of commission, but are simply charging an hourly rate for their advice. On mix: you should stay almost entirely in stocks at your age. after 50, start moving more into bonds, and buy the time you are 60, you want a 70% stock, 30% bond split. This is merely a guide; you will see when you do more reading that this ratio is affected by your age, your risk tolerance, and your plans for retirement age/post retirement income. Lastly, NEVER have more than 4% of your total net worth in a single stock. If you do, you are carrying substantial risk. If you want to buy stocks, then you MUST diversify to spread your risk. This is another reason why mutual funds are better - when you buy shares in a mutual fund, your money is being used to buy small amounts in dozens, or even hundreds, or separate stocks, which significantly reduces your risk.
        </p> Vanguard*** is ideal for long term investors who want to learn about mutual funds, index funds, and exchange-traded-funds (ETFs).   They have an outstanding reputation in the mutual fund industry. <br>
 <br>
Trading funds is less risky than trying to trade &quot;individual&quot; stocks.  You may also want to visit ishares*** to learn more about ETFs instead of mutual funds. <br>
 <br>
The websites below all contain plenty of FREE information to get you started in the right direction.
        </p> In general, investing in mutual funds is a good thing.  It allows you to invest in stocks and bonds without spending time researching financial reports of individual companies.  They can also reinvest the dividends and interest automatically.  In general, mutual funds simplify your investing life, leaving you time to do more interesting things. <br>
 <br>
Here are two good books that can teach you about mutual funds: <br>
 <br>
-  Mutual funds for Dummies, by Eric Tyson <br>
-  My free downloadable book at http://***invest-for-retirement*** <br>
 <br>
One of the most overlooked factors in mutual funds are the costs.  Most investors look at costs as an after-thought.  IMO, you should think about costs first, using them as a screening tool to weed out the undesirable funds.  In general, you will want to stick to mutual funds that have these characteristics: <br>
 <br>
- No load or deferred load. <br>
- No 12b-1 fees.  Loads and 12b-1 fees are for suckers. <br>
- Annual expense ratio less than 1%.  Preferably 0.5% or lower. <br>
- Annual turnover ratio less than 40% for stock funds. <br>
 <br>
Here are two good firms to find no-load mutual funds: <br>

-  http://***fidelity*** <br>

        </p> good well diversified. Protects you with multiple stocks in case one goes bad pick the right ones you have winners. <br>
 <br>
bad HIGH expense rations, govertment investigations some have high initial investment fees prices at end of day and can trade only ONCE per day (at closing) <br>
 <br>
If you are considering mutual fundf, take a LONG HARD look at ETF&#039;s.
        </p> Penny stocks are loosely categorized companies with share prices of below $5 and with market caps of under $200 million. They are sometimes referred to as &quot;the slot machines of the equity market&quot; because of the money involved. There may be a good place for penny stocks in the portfolio of an experienced, advanced investor, however, if you follow this guide you will learn the most efficient strategies https://tr.im/e3f14
        </p> Mutual funds are nothing more than a bunch of people pooling their moniey to buy large quantity of stocks.... so you are playing the stock market... this is ok as long as you are willing to take a risk which could involve taking a loss.... bigger risk typically = bigger gains ... but if you want security then stay with GIC&#039;c
        </p> Mutual funds are neither good nor bad.  They are what they are.  They might be appopriate for you, they might not.  You haven&#039;t provided anywhere near enough info. to even being to address that issue.  Try Money magazine, fool*** for some basics.
