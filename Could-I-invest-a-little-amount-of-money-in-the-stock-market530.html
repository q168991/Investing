</script><p> Research I-Bonds and you would see that you would get a fixed rate along with a variable semiannual inflation rate based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U). The catch is you have to leave the money within the account for 1year and if you withdrawal the money before the 5year mature date, you would have to pay back 3months interests on your money. You can not lose money and your money would always stay above the inflation rate by investing within I-Bonds anyway you can start with as little as $25 and the max to put into the account per year is 10K..Keep putting $25 into the account and you would be able to build a nice nest egg to get into the stock market game. If you are employed you should enroll into a 401K account and take the company match  <br>
