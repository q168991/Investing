</script><p> Since you are working for a BPO, I would suggest that you should open a 3-in-1 account with ICICI Direct***.   <br>
 <br>
3-in-1 means Saviving Account linked with Demat and Internet. For this you will require a PAN Card. Once you open the account you will be in a position to invest in shares online at your own convenience. <br>
 <br>
Before investing, do research of the company&#039;s in which you want to invest.  Understand the fundamentals of these company&#039;s.  <br>
 <br>
Good Luck

</script><p> invest in what you understand, this will be different from one person to another. if something appears to be incredible value, don&#039;t believe it read the financial press but also listen to what people are saying on the street. if a neighbour thinks a brand or a new store is good, so will thousands of other consumers. likewise bad! my policy is - keep half or more in savings accounts, the rest in shares. it is never wrong to take a profit, even if a share continues to go up after you have sold, it might just as easily have crashed.
        </p> You could start investing in Mutual funds which come out with sector specifc funds.  Once you gain good knowledge about the sectors then you can start directly investing in small amounts. <br>
 <br>
For direct investment in the equity market you need lot of time and money for doing research to identify growth stocks for investing. <br>

        </p> To start investing in shares I would suggest to start by investing in mutual funds first and later start investing/subscribing i n initial public issues. Any magazine on business and finance  will  give informATION on the mutual funds and initial public issue analysis.
        </p> Visit    http://***icicidirect***         &amp;  surf in details how to start  your investment business in shares, better you should first invest in top rated Mutual Funds.
        </p> if you are not sure about the share market but u want to earn frm shares....then u should start with equity mutual funds....
        </p> ask your boss.
