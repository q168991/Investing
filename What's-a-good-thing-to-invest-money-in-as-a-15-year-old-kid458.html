<h1>What&#039;s a good thing to invest money in as a 15 year old kid?</h1>
<div class="answer">I want to save my money by investing in something good. I&amp;#39;m 14 almost 15 and have a baseball card collection. Is that good to invest in? I need to invest in something and save my money, I would just save it but I like buying things. Also is their some way I can make money now online or by starting a business or something? I&amp;#39;m 6&amp;#39;5&amp;quot; and really strong if that helps with anything.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> The baseball card collection is good - hang onto it.  Hard assets, i.e., tangible things, are going to be the best thing to hold right now.  Paper assets - like stock, bonds, even dollar bills themselves - are going to undergo a tremendous change over the next few years.  Take a look back at this when you&#039;re in your mid-20&#039;s and you&#039;ll see that I was absolutely right. <br>
 <br>
If you had to bet on one hard asset over others, I&#039;d recommend buying silver coins.  You can buy one ounce coins in the form of American Eagles, for example - at current market rates, these are about $35 each.  Or, you could buy what they call &quot;junk silver&quot;, which is actually just half dollars, quarters, and dimes made before 1965.  Back then, they used to actually make these coins with 90% silver.  <br>
 <br>
It&#039;s a really long story, but from where we are in history right now, you&#039;ll be glad you have some silver saved.  Don&#039;t worry if it goes down in value over a period of a few months - over a period of a few years, you&#039;ll see that the silver holds its value while the dollar drops in value (i.e., the &quot;price&quot; of silver will continue to go up).  Keep in mind that just 4 years ago you could buy silver for $11 per ounce. <br>
 <br>
Starting your own business is also a good idea.  Learning some handyman skills would also be a good idea , not only because they can make you money right now, but because your skills are portable, will always be in demand, and no one can take them away from you.  I&#039;m glad to see someone your age anxious to be enterprising - hope that helps, and good luck.

</script><p> A 14-year old is much too young getting into investment. Collecting baseball card may weell be the option.  <br>
 <br>
Physically, you are 14 and 6&#039;5&quot;. You are a tall big boy and still growing. Why not concentrate in a sport that requires your height, such as basketball. When you are 18, 7&quot; tall, 1 year in a NCAA college and play good. You could be drafted in the NBA and could become an instant millionair.
        </p> Start learning about mutual funds, GIC&#039;s, bonds, and stocks by reading books and searching the web. <br>
 <br>
Maybe you should start a website about something you know a lot about and really like. Check out this website: http://***sitesell***/
        </p> start with researching..... <br>
 <br>
1. Investopedia <br>
If you are just beginning to learn about the world of investments, Investopedia is your one-stop shop for anything and everything. Here, you can look up definitions of terms, register for newsletters with valuable information, use their stock simulator to see how much an investment earns or loses over time, and much more. Y <br>
2. Yahoo! Finance <br>
Yahoo! Finance is just too good. Aside from the myriad of company reports, which you are required to pay for, all of the information at Yahoo finance is free for the taking. <br>
3. Motley Fool <br>
Whether you are looking to do your own research, or prefer the advice of a seasoned veteran, The Motley Fool has it all.  <br>
4. The Street <br>
If you pay any attention to the world of investing, you know the name Jim Cramer. Personally, I think he is little more than a caricature, but some people swear by him. Mr. Cramer is one of the “big name” contributors at The Street. That not withstanding, The Street is, in my humble opinion, the best website for investing related articles. The writers have vast knowledge and fantastic insight, without losing focus on what is important – the investors for whom they write. <br>
5. Wall Street Journal <br>
For decades, the Wall Street Journal newspaper has been a staple for information and research for investors. The Wall Street Journal online delivers even more valuable information than its nearly obsolete predecessor. Nowadays, the Journal’s online presence includes The Wall Street Journal, MarketWatch, Barron’s, and SmartMoney, among others. All of these sites are valuable resources for investing information, especially when seeking out company-specific news. <br>
6. MSN Money <br>
Microsoft tends to be a pretty self-serving company, at least in my opinion. Even so, once you learn to glance over all of the Microsoft related news at MSN Money, what you get is another fantastic avenue for portfolio boosting. The one complaint I have with MSN Money is the formatting. When looking at stock quotes, there are no lines distinguishing ads from news or charts, which occasionally will take you off-course by clicking an advertisement by mistake. <br>
7. Zack’s Investment Research <br>
Zack’s does require a membership in order to get to the juicy stuff, but the membership is free and well worth the three minutes it takes to sign up. Here, you will be able to do in-depth research on both stocks and funds. You will also have access to many public and independent reports that will assist you on your quest for the perfect personal investment portfolio. <br>
8. Investor Guide <br>
Investor Guide has many of the same features you’ll notice on other sites on this list, so why does it make my top ten? The stock helper tool. First, this tool helps you to determine an optimal investing strategy and style. Then, it provides a list of companies for you to research. Once your list is complete, you will see what others think of each company on your research list. Investor Guide does a great job of aggregating this information from many different sites for you. You will then evaluate the company’s competition, decide what to buy, and reap the benefits. <br>
9. Seeking Alpha <br>
Seeking Alpha is amazing. My one complaint is that there is actually too much information packed into one page, which at times can make it difficult to navigate. If it weren’t for the massive amount of content on Seeking Alpha, it would be much higher on this list. Company news is the main focus of the site, so if you have a list of companies to research, this is a pretty good place to start. <br>
10. Online Brokerages <br>
Personally, my account has been housed at Sharebuilder for years now, and their research tools are very good. In the beginning, they had a clumsy interface that was slow and filled with glitches. Since then, they have done an amazing job of streamlining and improving content to the point of near perfection. No matter who you invest with online, be sure to use their research tools, as most of them have easy to use interfaces with plenty of information to sort through. Some of the more popular online stock brokers include E*TRADE, TradeKing, Scottrade, and OptionsHouse. <br>
 <br>
When you are looking to conduct your own investment research, closely monitor where you go online. It is very easy to end up on “hot stock pick” sites, penny stock investing sites, or poorly executed attempts at legitimacy. Many of these sites are fronts for someone to sell you their “foolproof system” or something similar. Everything I have provided above is free of charge, though a few of them offer paid services above and beyond what most of us need. <br>
