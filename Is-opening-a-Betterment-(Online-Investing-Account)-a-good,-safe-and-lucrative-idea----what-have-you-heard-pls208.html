<h1>Is opening a Betterment (Online Investing Account) a good, safe and lucrative idea -- what have you heard pls?</h1>
<div class="answer">&amp;quot;...Savings accounts offer paltry interest rates that don’t keep up
with inflation. And investing in the stock market through traditional investing sites is risky—and complicated. Using a financial advisor often means high minimum deposits and management fees that eat away at your returns.

What’s the solution?

Betterment offers a better way—to save and invest your money. Betterment is the first secure online investing site that allows you to invest in a portfolio of stocks and bonds that’s tailored to you and your goals.



It’s straightforward. No prior investment experience is needed. Betterment takes the mystery out of the investing process by showing you how to invest your money in a portfolio of stocks and bonds in a blend that you tailor to your own preferences and goals.
It’s convenient. You can set up your Betterment account in minutes and add links to your bank account for easy transfers.
There&amp;#39;s no minimum. If you don&amp;#39;t have thousands of dollars to invest, that&amp;#39;s fine. Start with whatever amount is comfortable for you—whether that’s $10 or $10,000.
It’s low cost and flexible. Transfers and trades are always free, and you can withdraw your money at any time.&amp;quot;

</script><p> It does not look good.  I would be suspicious of the phrase &quot;tailored for you&quot;  - it just means they will saddle you with high commission products so they get to earn the commission. <br>
 <br>
If you really want safe and secure investing,  go and buy a Mutual Fund that tracks the S&amp;P from Fidelity or Vanguard.  They are solid, reputable companies that do what these guys claim, without the risk of being cheated.
