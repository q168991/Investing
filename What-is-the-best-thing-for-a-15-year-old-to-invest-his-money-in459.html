</script><p> Depends on your initial investment and lot&#039;s of other factors. <br>
To my mind the best way to invest money is to invest in someone&#039;s business. It&#039;s safer and more profitable. I have invested in good business and now I am getting guaranteed 40% annual interest. <br>
Note: I don&#039;t need your money but you may contact me for a good advice. <br>
I wish you success in your investments!

</script><p> I would recommend checking out some beginners investing books on ebay or amazon or even reading articles on the web. Also, check out investopedia*** or ***updown*** -- these sites allow you to manage a &#039;virtual portfolio&#039; of fake money with the real-time market. I would guess the minimum age for investing is the same as having your own savings account, which your parents can set up for you. Get out there, read up as much as possible-- thats my advice.
        </p> There are very good ways to invest depending up on your preferences and charecterisitcs. Select a investment option that suits you well and start making money an dkeep your investment safe
        </p> I am certain you have to be considered a legal adult of  eighteen to invest in securities, however, you can do certificates of deposit with your bank account. Ask a personal banker, they would probably be glad to see someone of your age desiring to invest in their future and steer you in the right direction.
        </p> there are many things to do your investments includes starting small business, acquiring of shares, purchase of own assets or build up yuor cash towards big assets
