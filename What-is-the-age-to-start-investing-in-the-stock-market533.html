</script><p> This is what my parents did. <br>
At 12, They opened up a custodial account at Schwab <br>
I don&#039;t think with a custodial account there was a minimum  <br>
(I think Fidelity requires a minimum) <br>
I was able to see my account online and buy cd&#039;s and no load mutual funds, and buy stocks. <br>
Making a bit of money on my cd&#039;s. <br>
Remember the word custodial account.   <br>
Enjoy investing - you might depend on your skills for your future. <br>

Then after learning a bit about investments, you might try an Index Fund or something similar that spreads your risk out over several companies.
