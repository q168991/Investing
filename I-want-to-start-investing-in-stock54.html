</script><p> The best investment now is to save as much as you can for a while and see how things go for a year or two. Or look into rental properties as an investment. And always watch the news for the rise and fall of stocks to see how the pattern seems to swing. You need to research as much as you can and come up with what will work for you. Not all people will have the same luck with stocks as the oil companies are doing.

</script><p> Stock market always well come a beginner i like your spirit to enter in stock market prepare yourself before start investing check some basics. as per my experience Never invest more what you have. No over trading Never follow any tips research your self or follow any one person.
        </p> A smart place to start is look at your own situation--if you are working for a company or business then find out more about how it works, does it pay dividends to shareholders? Are you entitled to invest in a share save scheme with the company? To expand your horizons further, look for share dealing websites that offer the opportunity to run &quot;fantasy&quot; portfolios and get signed up and get some experience BEFORE committing any money-have some fun,learn and make some mistakes first! <br>

        </p> This economy is going to suck for awhile. Possibly if we come out of this without our dollar going flat over a long period you may come out. But with technology today and the institutions and so many influences in the markets you could be robbed of your money real quick. You may want to buy gold coins and if your addiment about stocks the only industry that should be growing is energy for the next ten + years. Unless our govt and elected officials feel its better that we continue to buy our energy needs from other countrys at the tune of 700 billion a year.
        </p> A good starting point are the following two books <br>
 <br>
Investing for Dummies by Eric Tyson <br>
# ISBN-10: 0470289651 <br>
# ISBN-13: 978-0470289655 <br>
 <br>
Trading for Dummies by Lita Epstein and Michael Griffis <br>
# ISBN-10: 0764556894 <br>
# ISBN-13: 978-0764556890 <br>
 <br>
Both are available at amazon*** and bn*** . I actually own the second one which is an excellent read. I wish you the best in your venture into the market.
        </p> I don&#039;t suggest you talk to any investment banker, they don&#039;t really know much about investing. What you want to learn is how to trade, not invest. Short term is the way to go. As you can see, buy and hold is not a viable strategy. Educate yourself on how to analyze charts, aka technical analysis. A good site to start is ***stockcharts***, its free. Learn how to analyze trends, that&#039;s the key to trading. Read books about trading, and save up for seminars. And when you&#039;re ready, learn how to trade options. Cause you can get more buying power with less money.  <br>
 <br>
Good Luck, <br>

        </p> The best way to invest money is to invest in someone&#039;s existing business. I have invested in my friend&#039;s small business based in Europe and now I am getting guaranteed high returns (over 20% a year). Feel free to email me at pupking@luckymail*** for more details if interested. <br>

        </p> Talk to an investment company. <br>
Especially in this economic climate, you should read Money, Fortune, Black Enterprise and speak to some investors. <br>
I would also join MotleyFool*** for information. <br>
Charles Schwab, Fidelity and others will give you helpful advice...for free. <br>
Good luck.
        </p> You should start off by diversifying your money . Beginners should stick with mutual funds.  keep a five year time horizon. And do not invest all your money at once.
        </p> I would talk with a reputable investor in your area before attempting to get involved with stocks on your own.
