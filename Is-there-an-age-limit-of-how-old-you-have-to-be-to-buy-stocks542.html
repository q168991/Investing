</script><p> In the United States a person must be 18 to open a brokerage account in their name.   However, a parent, or guardian, can open a custodian account for a minor using the minor&#039;s social security number.  When the minor reaches the age of 18, they can open their own account and have the assets in the account moved to their account, <br>

You daughter is not too young to start investing, but she should know what she is doing, why she is doing it and how to do it.  I started when I was 12 but I had been studying on what to do &amp; how to do it. <br>
 <br>
As long as your daughter is not investing on emotions or some other immature idea, let her do it.    <br>
 <br>
Good luck to your daughter, if she studies well she&#039;ll invest even better. <br>

</script><p> Yes she would be to young <br>
You have to be at least 18 yrs of age  <br>
You could buy one for her in your name or a suggestion a lot of ppl do  <br>
is tell her to pick a stock put money aside and pretend she has her money in that stock and see how well she would do at picking a stock it gives her preparation before she turns 18 and it might help her to investigate and watch the stock market close enough so when she turns 18 she has a greater chance of being successful with it.
        </p> You have to be 18 in the UK to buy stocks.
        </p> 18 is minimum age to buy stocks.
        </p> In the US, you can open UTMA account at a brokerage for your daughter. You will be listed as &quot;custodian&quot; of the account, but she will own the funds. You will be the controlling party until she reaches age 21 and any withdrawals can only be made for her direct benefit and you are legally responsible to see to this. The UTMA desolves when she turns 21 and will be hers free and clear.
        </p> you definitely have to be 18, but wow, 12yr old having that kind of money, go girl! Maybe you can just be the &quot;stock buyer&quot; instead of her.
        </p> u need to have a bank account, demat account &amp; trading account , min age 18 (or can jointly opened with an adult,)
        </p> encourage here to move forward in new genration 12 yera is nothing <br>
