<h1>Which Investing Company Should I Choose??</h1>
<div class="answer">There&amp;#39;s so many investing companies out there, but I don&amp;#39;t know which one to pick esp. since there have been many financial scandals in the past such as Putnam etc. who have been dipping their hands into customers accounts.

I thought about Fidelity, T-Rowe Price, Vanguard, Charles Schwab, Merrill Lynch &amp; the list goes on. So which one is best, knowing I don&amp;#39;t have to panic in case CEOs, CFOs inflate their compensation by taking people&amp;#39;s $$ (this is just one way customers account are fiddled with). What do you think?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Firstly be glad there are so many thanks to good old competition you re getting a good deal lol.  There are literally people day and night that own these investment companies that are trying to kill each other and give you a better deal on you stuff.  This is getting to be a dieing idea in the USA with big companies like wal-mart, but remember when there is a lot of competition there is someone trying to give you a good deal ;).  I mean think back to when the only online place as like etrade and they are now almost out of business.  Now firstly if your letting a broker handle your bucks-unless he is a well known Manhattan broker with a great record and so on and is charging large fees it&#039;s not worth it.  Just do the investing yourself you will be a lot better off in the long run.  As for online accounts-from my personal experience&#039;s the cheapest one so far is Zecco-look it up on google.  BTW the way to make money in stocks is to buy undervalued ones ;).  The way to do that is have good judgement on whether or not the current stock price is too low or too high based on the company.  But speaking of wal-mart look at them they were in like 39 bucks about 4 months ago.  Now they are close to 50 so pretend I was rich I invest say 200,000 in wal mart 200,000/39 tha&#039;s 5128 shares and now they are worth say 50 bucks that&#039;s 11 dollars profit per share so 11 times 5128 that&#039;s 56,408 dollars profit ;).  In like 5 months or less GET MY POINT????????  Think undervalued.   <br>
 <br>
Peace

</script><p> Are you looking to buy stock or find a company that you can place money through? My company does real estate placement for investors. 1. Determine what your financial goals are for your investments. 2. Determine your risk tolerance. 3. Identify how long you wish to invest. Are you going to need the money in 2 weeks, a year, 10years? This will place limits on what you can invest in. 4. If you don&#039;t feel comfortable. Don&#039;t do it. Trust your instinct
        </p> If you want a quick return on your money then trading in cfd,s is the way to go.  <br>
You dont actually buy shares as such but buy a contract on the assets.  <br>
You then earn or lose money on the opening and closing price of the asset.  <br>
Many people have got rich very quick from cfd&#039;s but there is also the risk of losing money quickly. <br>
Finding a broker will help as they can advice you on stops that sell when the  <br>
asset falls below a certain amount you can afford to lose. <br>

        </p> our first option should be to fund fully a retirement account. If you do this, and you have extra cash, then one of the best things you can do is open a DRIP Plan. <br>
 <br>
Go to : low-cost-stock-recommendations <br>
 <br>
*** <br>
 <br>
They have a DRIP Section and it is free. <br>
 <br>
These powerful investment plans are seldom talked about because brokers make very little money when they suggest them. Yet, they have proven to be one of the best, if not the best, long-term strategy on Wall Street.  <br>
 <br>
They are perfect for small investors, as well as big investors. They are safe and allow you to not care about whether the market is going up or down. They are a must for any serious investor. <br>
 <br>
I strongly recommend looking into it. They are great plans.
        </p> instead of investment company ,how about open yourself a asset managed account? <br>
