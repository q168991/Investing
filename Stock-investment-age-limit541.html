</script><p> There is no limit. <br>
You can be 100 years old. <br>
Did you mean mimum?  18 to open any account in the US of any kind. <br>
 <br>
Buy $100 worth of stock.  It will cost you $9.95 to buy. <br>
(and to sell another $9.95). <br>
Boom you just lost 10% of your investment buying something. <br>
Good god.   People struggle for years to make 10% <br>
 <br>
Fees will eat you up alive. <br>
Like flies on a dead cat off the side of a road in a hot 90 degree summer.

        </p> Hi there, <br>
You should try with Penny Stocks Trading (you can find more info here: http://pennystocks.toptips.org) <br>
 <br>
Penny stocks, also known as cent stocks in some countries, are common shares of small public companies that trade at low prices per share.  <br>
I&#039;ve been subscribing to this PennyStock web site for about a year now and have loved the objective advice they give. He really does look for quality stocks and I&#039;ve made some pretty nice profits on a lot of his suggestions. Being still fairly new to investing I have been dabbling a lot in penny stocks to try and grow my account. I may not have a big account, but it&#039;s a lot bigger than it was a year ago. On just one of Nathan&#039;s picks this year I managed to make my investment back ten-fold! Be careful! Penny stocks are notoriously risky but if you follow the right method the risk is almost 0. I suggest to invest only little money first and then reinvest the profits. This is the site I&#039;m using: http://pennystocks.toptips.org <br>
Bye
        </p> Ask your parents to help set up a custodian account for you to put your money into. That is the only way to buy stocks until you turn 18. Pretty much any broker will do, but since you are investing so little money, go for one with a very low commission.
        </p> With penny stocks you can make 30 percent or 40 percent profit in a few days. Learn here https://tr.im/learnpennystock <br>
 <br>
The best strategy, if you do have experience type of return on a penny stock, is to sell the stock quickly.  <br>
 <br>
Of course, it’s easier said than done. The natural thing to want when you see an increase in stock price is to hold the stock and hope for an even larger increase.
        </p> by reading the rules of a broker you can see what the fees are to have an brokeraccount <br>
 <br>
you are younger than 18 thus your legal guardians both of one of them should sign the contract with the broker  <br>
 <br>
thus the broker should have the possibility taht a minor does any trading from buying and selling but with the following exceptions  <br>
 <br>
look at the site of the bank where you have a saving account if they have possibilities <br>
 <br>
it is better to read carefully all the different leaflets and rules and costs and talk always with your legal guardians before doing anything <br>
 <br>
it is not a bad idea to compare with an amount of $100 decide is this inlus the fee or not <br>
 <br>
the total amount of money invested is the amount of money you can loose
        </p> Penny stocks are loosely categorized companies with share prices of below $5 and with market caps of under $200 million. They are sometimes referred to as &quot;the slot machines of the equity market&quot; because of the money involved. There may be a good place for penny stocks in the portfolio of an experienced, advanced investor, however, if you follow this guide you will learn the most efficient strategies https://tr.im/4ed13
        </p> Two things - you are not old enough to open an account yourself - you will need a guardian (parent) to open an account for you.  Second, minimum investments are $500, so you do not have enough money to open an account.
        </p> You could be 2 years old. There is no age limit, it&#039;s your money.  <br>
Edit: To below, young&#039;uns get custodian accounts
        </p> You are too young to open your own account. You are too young/ haven&#039;t enough money to start thinking about investing in the market.
