</script><p> I would say Panama, it&#039;s the undiscovered pearl of Central America, well ... people are noticing it now. Great potential for the future and they have the US dollar there.  <br>
Anyway, it&#039;s my opinion, invest in Panama. <br>
 <br>
And I can remember something about fraudulent tree (hardwood?, palmtree?) investments in Costa Rica

</script><p> while you&#039;re from the U. S. i might advise Panama..the adaptation in the two international locations is amazingly super..yet you&#039;ve gotten the potential to locate many American places in Panama and a lot of yank type conforts such because of the fact the dollar...you&#039;ve gotten a problematic time adjusting extra in Costa Rica than in Panama....Costa Rica is extra Rustic and much less modern-day..Panama could have the two, however the city is probable the main modern-day between the two international locations...
        </p> Do Not buy Real Estate in Costa Rica.  I think it was Forbes that had an article on squatters and owners who hired &quot;guards&quot; to keep squatters out.  Some &quot;guards&quot; sold the owners&#039; land - without permission.  The courts in Costa Rica are Not friendly to foreign investors.
        </p> Both countries
        </p> BOTH contries are really amaizing!
