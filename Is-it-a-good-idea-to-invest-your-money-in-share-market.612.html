</script><p> Investing in stocks is one of the various options u have. However, this should soly depend on your investment objectives and risk that you are willing to take. Stocks are a good means of generating a higher than Bank deposit rates. To risk averse, you can choose Mutual Funds with allocation in to Debt and partly in to equity instead of directly investing in stocks.

        </p> Hey just so you know it&#039;s usually called a stock market. ;) Anyway, I&#039;d reccomend buying stock directly from companies, over 200 companies offer this.  If you stick to large companies there is very little risk, but not as much proffit opurtunity as with a smaller riskeir company, for instance, if you invested $1,000 in Microsoft (MSFT) when they went public it would we worth well over $400,000 today.  But if microsoft had flopped, you would have lost your money.  You can invest in any company you want, i&#039;d reccomend companies General Electric (GE) Costco wholesale corp (COST) Exxon-mobil (XOM) Best Buy (BBY) Microsoft (MSFT) all of which sell stock directly to the public even with initial purchases.  The requirments are obviously money, a checking account to mail a check to the company (or if you&#039;re under 18 like i am then a parent with one.)  But that&#039;s about it, some of the companies also require a minimum initial purchase most of them being $250, some $500 and some $1,000.  Well, good luck in the market, i highly recomend investing in it, i started just about a year ago (I&#039;m now 15) and have made about $300 from my original $950.  Also read some books, if your under 18 i recommend Street wise a guide for teen investors by Janet Bamford, or if your over 18 then i recomend Jim Crammers Real Money, heck read em both :P good luck fellow share holder.
        </p> Share Market is highly speculative investment. You must learn about subject fully before you venture into this business. And it needs constant watch. If you want to enter the Share Market as an investment option, you may have to be very careful and ready to take the risk.If you are particular in entering share market, Mutual Funds are better option. Since the Mutual Funds also deal in Shares, they have specially trained people to handle it.  Yes there is quick money gains in Share Market, but you must also be prepared for quick losses.
        </p> Since you have no knowledge about share market transactions, it would be advisable for you to first go for mutual funds. Mutual funds is also a kind of investment where a lot of people pool their money and then it is invested in the market. Subsequently, when you become acquainted with the terminology and procedure of the market you can directly invest in share market.
        </p> Well i&#039;m 14. And i&#039;ve got shares myself. <br>
2 years back, i invested $850 (my own money) into a bank. It cost me $50 for commission. <br>
The starting price of one share was $32.27 and i had 23 shares. <br>
At the moment the price of one share is now $49.50, and since i bought the shares every 6 months ive been getting $25 dividend, and you don&#039;t do anything. And ive had about 5 of them so ive made 125 bucks doing nothing. If i sold my shares now i would probably have $1400. <br>
 <br>
So yeh it&#039;s a great idea, one tip is buy in banks, they always go up. Well ....most do.
        </p> Knowing how to secure your financial well-being is one of the most important things you’ll ever need in life. You don’t have to be a genius to do it. You just need to know a few basics, form a plan, and be ready to stick to it. There is no guarantee that you’ll make money from investments you make. But if you get the facts about saving and investing and follow through with an intelligent plan, you should be able to gain financial security over the years and enjoy the benefits of managing your money.
        </p> First of all, Open 2 Accounts with any broker who is also Depository Participant. 1. Demat Account (For get credit of equity shares you purchase) and 2. Trading Account (To do online and offline trading). Also, Open a Savings Bank Account with any tech savvy banks (i.e. HDFC Bank, ICICI Bank, UTI Bank, IDBI Bank etc.) to transfer / receive funds to / from your broker&#039;s bank account. <br>
 <br>
There are many brokers who are doing online trading for you. I would recommend ***5paisa*** (I am doing with them since last 3 years and as of now, No complaints). <br>
 <br>
Invest only in Nifty Stocks (Equity Shares listed in National Stock Exchnage - Top 50 Stocks) and I am sure that you will NEVER lose your money. For more details, email me on aramaiya@yahoo*** to learn more about the Stock market.
