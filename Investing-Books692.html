        </p> Investing for Dummies <br>
 <br>
This is a real book..The dummy series is well known in North America for its inciteful explanation of many diverse topics.
        </p> The secret word of trading success is &quot;organized&quot;. You can&#039;t be successful without a strategy, a plan and some kind of technological support. I use a software called &quot;autobinary signals&quot; that is helping me a lot. There are plenty of them on the market. I recommend this one because it&#039;s very easy to use (you don&#039;t have to be an expert or have special skills to make money with it). <br>
 <br>
 Check it out here. It&#039;s worth it: http://tradingsignal.toptips.org
        </p> start with Investing for dummies by Eric Tyson.
        </p> read tips on investing , stocks and much more to help you on this site
        </p> Hi, <br>
 <br>
  The best software is Vector Vest if you can afford it. <br>
 <br>
   Here is a free Web site for charting stocks:  (http://***incrediblecharts***/). <br>
 <br>
   First of all, stay away from &quot;professional brokers&quot; and tips coming to you via e-mail or friends and acquaintances.  <br>
 <br>
   Hey!  They will say anything to get you to buy their junk.  If it&#039;s too good to be true, it is. <br>
 <br>
   Remember this, they are just sales people trying to sell you what their firm is pushing.  They are not security analysts or financial planners, not even financial advisers.  Trust me, I know from experience that they cannot be trusted especially with a million dollars.  You risk losing it all.  A million dollar account is known as a &quot;whale&quot; and they would love to get their greedy little paws on it and suck it dry.  They just want to make commissions on what they buy and sell for the suckers, err...clients.. <br>
 <br>
   Risk avoidance is the name of the game. <br>
 <br>
   Remember, the harder I work, the luckier I get. <br>
 <br>
   Penny stocks are great and speculative, but I would avoid the ones under a dollar a share.  For example, Best Buy started at less than $5.  So there are some good companies, but it takes a lot of digging to find the good ones.  You are looking for companies with good earnings, little debt, low capitalization, and good P/Es.  For stocks under $5, very few will meet these requirements. <br>
 <br>
   Stay away from the pharms unless they have patented drugs - do not invest in generic pharms,  no growth there. <br>
 <br>
  Check out which business sectors are the most popular and invest in the companies in those sectors.  The number one, two and three are:  technology, health care, and cyclicals (retail).  These change every few months. <br>
 <br>
    Watch CNBC, but don&#039;t pay too much attention to the talking heads, except for Jim Cramer, the wild man - but he tries to teach you how to invest and has some great advice. <br>

   Rule #1: The Simple Strategy for Successful Investing in Only 15 Minutes a Week!  by Phil Town .  See his Web site at (http://***ruleoneinvestor***/).  Free sign-up.  I got the book at the library. <br>
 <br>
   Listen.  You don&#039;t have to spend a lot of money on these books - most can be found at your library and those that your library doesn&#039;t have they can usually get from other libraries in your state. <br>
 <br>
   Most of these books talk about stock and mutual fund investing, but for a good introduction to other forms of investing Gerald Appel has a great book called Opportunity Investing - How to Profit When Stock Advance, Stocks decline, Inflation Run Rampant, Prices fall, Oil Prices Hit the Roof and Every Time In Between. <br>
 <br>
   First, Break All the Rules: What the World&#039;s Greatest Managers Do Differently by Marcus Buckingham and Curt Coffman   Not a book on investing, but it&#039;s a nice segue into the next book. <br>
 <br>
   Now, Discover Your Strengths by Marcus Buckingham and Donald O. Clifton  <br>
 <br>
   Go Put Your Strengths to Work: 6 Powerful Steps to Achieve Outstanding Performance by Marcus Buckingham  <br>
 <br>
   Finding your strengths is important when investing.  These books teach you to build on your strengths, what you a good at.  Everyone is good or passionate about  something.  Why not get better at what you are good at? <br>
 <br>
  Another good book is:  Opportunity Investing: How To Profit When Stocks Advance, Stocks Decline, Inflation Runs Rampant, Prices Fall, Oil Prices Hit the Roof, ... and Every Time in Between (Hardcover) <br>
by Gerald Appel <br>
 <br>
   Most mutual funds do not even keep up the the return on the S&amp;P.  That&#039;s like 99% of them. <br>
 <br>
  Vanguard Index funds are a no brainer. <br>
 <br>
   A CD is better than a savings account.  They range from six months to several years.  You cannot touch your money tho until the time limit is up. <br>
 <br>
   Check out this Web site on Direct Investment Plans where you can buy shares directly from companies:  (http://***fool***/School/DRIPs.htm).  Usually no fees and you can buy one share at a time. <br>
 <br>
   Bonds are probably the safest.  You might try a bond fund.  They might return 5 or 6 percent.  At 5% a million would return $50,000 a year - not a bad income.  Remember, you have to pay taxes on the $50,000. <br>
 <br>
   There are also municipal bonds and the income from them is taxfree especially if you buy them in a state that offers them, but they only pay about 3%, but it&#039;s mostly taxfree. <br>
 <br>

P.S.  This is a life-long learning process.  Reading these books and applying the rules to analyzing stocks that may be good   It takes time.  Be patient and keep reading and listening. <br>
 <br>
P.P.S.  Internet has lots of good stuff, for example (http://stockcharts***/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_average_conve <br>
Stockcharts*** is very good and their discussion of MACD is one of the best, barring its originator, Gerald Apple, but now we are getting into Technical Analysis and that is not for beginners.
