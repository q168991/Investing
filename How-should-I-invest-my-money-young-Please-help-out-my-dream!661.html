</script><p> I personally like gold and precious metals. I started investing in gold a few years ago and haven&#039;t looked back. I recommend checking out goldinvestmentletter*** for more current information on the market.

</script><p> Look as if your in financial position, making @$70K a year, living rent free. I&#039;d suggest you put your money in long term investment. Stock market is not a bad place to invest in. Your young age allows you to take a bit more risk. Invest in conventional industries, GE, Boeing, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Proc-Gamble, 3-M, Walmart. Be diversified. Never in Hi-Tech. Buying a house is not a bad idea unless you are prepared to live in it. Las Vegas is not a bad place to invest in real properties. But how could you look after a property where is 100&#039;s or 1000&#039;s miles away?
        </p> Forget the bank, forget the stock, house possibly.  I put equal amounts into stocks and some physical silver a little over 30 years ago; the stock went down; the silver has gone from $ 3.00 an ounce to over 30.00 so the 100K I put in silver is now worth over a million dollars.  Judging from the way they are running the printing presses and churning out paper dollars 24/7 I would venture to say that silver is still the best buy as it has only one want to go; up, up and away.
        </p> Do not invest all your money, save part of it in the bank. Best investment you can look into are gold, silver, stocks, real estate and even buying tax lien certificates. Since you are a first time investor you can hire a business coach, expert in the kind of business you choose.
        </p> At the age of 21 I would recommend that you invest in your education first; and I am NOT talking about college.  There are 3 basic types of education...Academic, what you learned in grade school, high school.  Professional education, what you learn in collage or on the job training, and Financial education, knowledge about money. <br>
  Everyone spends some time in grade school and high school, and some have college but almost NOBODY learns anything about finances. Before investing in ANYTHING, spend time learning about money and investing.  Learn the 3 types of income; earned, portfolio, and passive; and how each is taxed.  Learn about President Nixon taking us off the &quot;Gold Standard&quot; in 1971 and how that is hurting most people.  Learn about the changes in retirement planning that took place in 1974 when most companies went from Defined Benefit Accounts to Defined Contribution Accounts and how that is effecting current and future retirements. <br>
  There are thousands of people TODAY marching in Wall Street because they are scared of the future, uneducated on the real facts of money, and have NO CLUE as to what they want, how to fix it, and how to grow in today&#039;s new marketplace.  They &quot;protest&quot; but do not even know what they are protesting other then the fact that what they are doing is not working for them. <br>
  Read books such as Richest Man In Babylon, Millionaire Next Door, Rich Dad Poor Dad. <br>
  Before you start putting your money to work, read and develope a PLAN on how you want to invest, HOW you will deal with tax&#039;s, HOW you control the investment, and WHAT you want to accomplish. <br>
  Some people win millions of dollars in the lottery or i big contracts to play sports and MOST lose everything because they have NEVER learned how to handle money.  Invest in YOURSELF with eduction and then think about stocks, bonds, real estate, gold.
        </p> Stock is still the best money maker in the U. S.(savings rates are pitiful at best).  Look at dividend stocks and bond.
