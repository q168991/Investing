<h1>How can I make tons of money by investing $1000?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am aware that the investment climate is looking a bit bearish at the moment. I have never invested before, but can anyone give me any tips as to where to invest considering the state of the economy right now?  There is a Chinese word which means both &amp;#39;crisis&amp;#39; and &amp;#39;opportunity&amp;#39;, and I would like to avail myself of any opportunities such a market can afford right now. Where to invest - gold? Oil?  Silver?  How can I make lots of money quickly?  Alternately, how can I make lots of money by investing $1000?  How much am I likely to make? How does this work?  Also, how do I go about investing in said stocks or whatever? I am a newbie, obviously, but I know a few things.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> There are many ways to take advantage of the current economic crisis but some may be frowned upon even though they are legal. The main thing is to familiarise yourself with them. So you&#039;re Canadian and you&#039;re looking from a Canadian point of view, but if you travelled a little to see how some poorer countries work you&#039;ll get a different interpretation of ethics. <br>
Now although it&#039;s frowned upon in more modern countries, money lending is legal and quite a part of everyday life in many eastern european  countries. You offer finance secured on property and actually have the property transferred to your name until the deal is complete. Now that might sound underhand, but when you consider that people actually trade in property here, it&#039;s not quite as underhand as it appears. (i.e. someone will give you a flat in exchange for work in many of these countries). <br>
Then there are other ways, and there&#039;s a legal term for this which i&#039;ve forgotten now, there are actually solicitors (i think you call them lawyers!) who are specifically employed to work these things out. I&#039;ll give an example: A large food chain in America or Canada may have a deal with a chocolate company in Switzerland such that they are the sole retailer. In other words in exchange for a guaranteed yearly trade the chocolate company will refuse to allow any other company to import their chocolates. However, if you were to set up a company in an eastern european country which has no such deals and you imported from Switzerland to the eastern european country, then exported to the US or Canada, you could distribute to whoever you liked! <br>
It&#039;s the law of loopholes! (big money in chocolates by the way!)

</script><p> If you want to make tons of money quickly, you&#039;re talking high risk, highly leveraged investments.  An example of a high risk-high leverage investment is options.  They allow you to control very large sums of money with relatively small investments.  Buying options is like walking up to the plate at the bottom of the 9th inning in the last game of the World Series and swinging for the fences.  You&#039;ll probably strike out.  But if you hit a home run, you&#039;ll be a hero. <br>
 <br>
Caution: Options are not for newbies.  MOST people lose money investing (speculating, really) in options.  Don&#039;t go there unless you enjoy swimming with sharks--great whites. <br>
 <br>
A better approach would be to open an account with a decent discount broker, learn to &quot;paper trade&quot;, and then start trading stocks with real money.
        </p> How does Trading Work? I can say you that take a look at this site ( http://forexsignal.kyma.info ) may be it can help you. It &#039;s one of the best course about trading. It seems like Trading is almost totally based on Macro-economics. It also strikes me that since there are not nearly as many currencies as there are stocks/bonds/derivatives etc etc, there must be a large number of market players in each currency bracket. So logically, currencies must be very liquid true? Also, what is the risk of Currency trading, high or low? When I read the business section every day I notice that the Canadian loonie moves hardly a tenth of a cent on a regular basis (in comparison to the US dollar). So it seems like theres very little room for growth in currencies unless you leverage. On that note, whats the maximum leverage permitted for forex trading. I know in stocks its x2, and in derivatives its x10. Anyway the only way to know how to start a profitable buisness is by following some methods like the one that I suggested.
        </p> I&#039;m a college student just getting into the stock market. I figure I would rather learn now when I&#039;m young than to learn when I&#039;m 50. I&#039;d rather lose my money now rather than then.  <br>
 <br>
The best way for you to make money is to look at high risk, high reward stocks. Preferably pink sheet stocks. There are big risks however the payoffs can be massive. I knew a friend who invested $2,000 and in 2 years the stock matured and he made $100,000. It was one of those pink sheet stocks. They are hard to find, but when you find a good one, it has the chance to EXPLODE. Look into Sarissa Resources (SRSR). I have some money invested in them.
        </p> With penny stocks you can make 30 percent or 40 percent profit in a few days. Learn here https://tr.im/E0VH3 <br>
 <br>
The best strategy, if you do have experience type of return on a penny stock, is to sell the stock quickly.  <br>
 <br>
Of course, it’s easier said than done. The natural thing to want when you see an increase in stock price is to hold the stock and hope for an even larger increase.
        </p> Here&#039;s a basic trading rule you need to know right now; <br>
 <br>
Searching &amp; investing for the &quot;home run&quot; is a sure fire way to lose a lot of money quickly. <br>
The market pays money to those that understand it and the rules of Trading Money Management. <br>
 <br>
It can take years to &quot;master&quot; the art of trading. 90% of the traders that try swing or day trading fail. <br>
 <br>
I&#039;m constantly reading new trading books (and reading some old ones too). I attend webinars regularly.  My broker has training webinars at least once a week (ThinkOrSwim). <br>
 <br>
Typical mistakes of new traders; <br>
Not understanding the &quot;basics&quot; of trading. <br>
Not having a plan for each trade. <br>
Not having stops. <br>
Trading penny stocks (stocks under $5). <br>
Not having targets. <br>
Not learning Technical Analysis. <br>
Not being consistent with your trading rules. <br>
Not having discipline.
        </p> In binary options you will have the possibility to predict the movement of various assets such as stocks, currency pairs, commodities and indices. Learn how you can make money trading binary options https://tr.im/vUvMh <br>
An option has only two outcomes (hence the name “binary” options). This is because the value of an asset can only go up or down during a given time frame. Your task will be to predict if the value of an asset with either go up or down during a certain amount of time.
        </p> The only way you can make extremely high returns is to take extremely high risks.  And when you take large risks, you have to be willing to accept the fact that there are no guarantees, and that the bigger the risk, the more likely it is that you will lose some or all of your money.   <br>
 <br>
If you are willing to take the chance with a big risk, go for penny stocks (also called &quot;pink sheets&quot; or &quot;over the counter&quot; stocks).  These generally have a lot of volatility compared to mid to large cap stocks.

         put it in to a safe, conservative company that is undervalued, and pays a high dividend, .As an example take bank of ireland shares they have halved in the last 12 months, they pay a high dividend and will start to come back up eventually. this is only an example
        </p> Buy gravel, and hope there is gold in it. <br>
Buy a gun, and rob banks (lol). <br>
Buy a college education.
