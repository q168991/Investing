<h1>I am an 18 years old college freshmen, should I begin investing?</h1>
<div class="answer">I have a part time job that pays about $300-500 dollars a month. I want to invest the money instead of spending it on fast food and what not so when I eventually graduate from law school I have some money already saved up. My parents will pay for my education so this money I make is my money to spend. Here are my questions:

1) I want to know if you would recommend I start to invest now?

2)Where should I make my portfolio? I looked at E-Trade and it said you needed a $500 deposit to keep the account active.  

3) What to invest in? I am not too concerned about making a lot of money, I just want the time it takes for me in school, (and probably even longer) to help me accumulate more money. That being said I wouldn&amp;#39;t want to take great risks in order to make a killing, I just want steady growth. I read that investing in diverse mutual funds would be a way to make 7% profit per year, and I was wondering if someone could clear this up for me. Not knowing ANYTHING about investing I might have interpreted the article wrong. 

Thanks in advance, I might post again in order to bump because I am posting rather late at night.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> One of the constant themes of financial textbooks is that compounding gets more and more powerful the longer the time horizon. Consider that $10,000 invested at 11% for 10 years is only $167,220, while the same amount invested for 40 years is roughly $5,818,261 – four times as long results in nearly 35x as much money in your accounts. That is why it is so vitally important for you to start as young as you can; put money into a Roth IRA and always, always, always take the 401k contribution match provided by your employer. <br>
 <br>
It is more time efficient for you to purchase ETF exchange traded funds or mutual funds rather than individual stocks.  You do not have the time or the expertise to learn all that you need to know to invest successfully.   <br>
 <br>
If you want something more than a savings account you must hire a qualified financial adviser to invest for you.  Check the credentials for education and licensing and background to create a successful portfolio for you.  (You would be amazed at how easy it is to call yourself an investment representative or a financial adviser.)

</script><p> 1. Yes <br>
2.  E-Trade, Ameritrade, Scott Trade all seem fine as long as you can meet their minimum. <br>
3.  Start by buying shares of companies that you like.  If you have an Apple computer or a Sprint phone, or use P&amp;G toothpaste, that is not a bad place to start.  Or maybe you might feel more comfy with index funds.  And since you are starting so young, I would suggest the more risky growth, small cap, or international funds.  But please diversify, and do not get greedy.
        </p> No - not if &quot;investing&quot; means playing with stocks.  Keep your powder (money) dry -  put it in the bank and concentrate on school. <br>
 <br>
It&#039;s great that you are interested in investing, but learn first - and this forum is not the place to do so.  Start by reading &quot;Personal Finance For Dummies&quot; and &quot;Investing For Dummies.&quot;  Those are great books for young adults.
