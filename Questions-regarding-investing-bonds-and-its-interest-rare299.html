</script><p> The yield on a bond can change based on market conditions.  If interest rates go up, the value of the bond will go down and vice versa.  As a bond holder, you are a creditor of the corporation.  If it goes bankruptcy, you might not collect.  Check out Yahoo Finance

</script><p> Before investing in bonds, you must determine whether the interest rate is fixed or variable. When it is variable, it can be based on market conditions, e.g. LIBOR or London Interbank Overnight Rate, over which the issuer of the bond may not have control. It is up to you as the lender to weigh the risks whether a variable or a fixed rate is favorable to you or not. You can only be guaranteed a repayment if the lender is a government, i.e. the borrower is the government itself of any nation. If the borrower is a private entity, and unfortunately it went bankrupt, it would depend upon the laws applicable to the bond issue. Usually, liabilities owing to government will be first paid. After that, other creditors would be paid based on the priority it was given when it was issued. Your bond may have higher or lower priority than other liabilities of the entity.
        </p> In the case of US savings bonds you pay a certain price for the bond be it $25, $50, $100 they will have a maturity date. Once they mature that&#039;s all they will earn so one must cash it in and re-invest. If you buy one hundred dollar bond per month and file it continue this each month you will reach a date that you be buying a bond and cashing a bond religiously every month. It is then you begin feeling the rewards. You should do this as payment to yourself for working that month. It&#039;s a system my parents taught me to earn my retirement. You are your own employee and you set your rate of pay that you get from each week worked. This goes into an investment for your future and isn&#039;t existent for any other reason.
        </p> It depends on the terms of the bond.  Some longer term (say 10 or more years) bonds may have a variable rate. Most are not, but you would be wise to double check.  If you don&#039;t understand the investment, don&#039;t do it. <br>
 <br>
Bonds are subject to the ability of the borrower to pay it back. <br>
Bonds from the US Treasury are ok.  Bonds are rated by rating services.  Ratings of AAA are fine. <br>
 <br>
Bonds from Jeff68005&#039;s holding company are a bit shaky now. (jk).
        </p> There are variable rate bonds.  Bondholders are guaranteed the interest and principal  by contract.  Bondholders are creditors so they get paid before stockholders in a bankruptcy.
