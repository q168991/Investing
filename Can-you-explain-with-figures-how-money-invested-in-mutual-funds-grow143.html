<h1>Can you explain with figures how money invested in mutual funds grow?</h1>
<div class="answer">I find claims in various websites that due to compounding effect, invested amount in good mutual funds is expected to reach very high value after say 15-20 years. However, I am yet to see that explained with figures. Can anyone please give an example with figures how this happens? Suppose you start with SIP of Rs2500 per month and the starting month, NAV is Rs200. Now assuming certain annual return rate, show what this amount will be after say 20 years. Please explain clearly what you mean by &amp;quot;return percentage&amp;quot;, that is one crucial point I do not fully understand, since it appears different conventions are used while declaring return rate by different mutual fund houses.
Or you may direct me to any website you know where such detailed calculations are shown.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> go to ***moneycontrol*** <br>
 <br>
and ***nseindia***/mutualfunds <br>
 <br>
and these returns are calculated like annual compound interest instead of simple interest <br>
 <br>
nav of 200 can become 20 to 2000 or 5000 in 20 years

</script><p> They are average % return over 3, 5, and 10 years and not compounded. Just add the % return for each year and divide by the number of years involved. If the fund lost 50% the first year, then it would take a 100% return the next year to be even. So if the account had 10K had the following returns: <br>
Year 1: +10 <br>
Year 2: -20 <br>
Year 3: +15 <br>
Year 4: +5 <br>
Year 5: +20 <br>
Total: +30 or 30/5 = 6% average over 5 years and account would grow to $13,382 <br>
 <br>
But in reality based on the actual returns annually here follows how the account did: <br>
Year 1: +10, $11,000 <br>
Year 2: -20, $8,800 <br>
Year 3: +15, $10,120 <br>
Year 4: +5, $10,626 <br>
Year 5: +20, $12,751 which is less than the average return calculation. This lower amount is based upon a compounded annual yield of 4.9806% over 5 years. The compounded yield would be the appropriate number to report but is not. <br>
 <br>
The mutual fund industry uses the average returns to deceive potential shareholders into investing in mutual funds since it gives a false higher return number.
        </p> Mutual fund investments are subject to market risk and there is no sure percent returns when you invest in Mutual fund. One benefit which you can think about is the 10-30% tax savings you make on investing the amount which is sureshot. The return of investment is all dependent on market situations

You can easily calculate it by using FV formula in excel. <br>
