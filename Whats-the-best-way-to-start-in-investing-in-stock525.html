</script><p> The stock market can be risky at the best of times, even for experienced investors.  However, everyone has to start somewhere, and if you do not start now then when will you acquire the necessary experience? <br>
 <br>
Do read some books on the subject.  Visit your local book store and find a book that you like and feel comfortable with. <br>
 <br>
Some of the titles I have on my bookshelf include: <br>
One Up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch <br>
How to make money in Stocks by William J. O’Neil (Founder of Investor’s Business Daily) <br>
The Millionaire Next Door by Thomas J Stanley and William D Danco <br>
 <br>
heck out web sites like fool*** and yahoo finance. <br>
Investigate trading strategies with a proven track record over 3, 5, 10, and 15 years. <br>
 <br>
Pick something that you understand, find easy to use, will help you realise your goals, and where you can take responsibility for your investments and be in full control of your capital. <br>
 <br>
Systems like the Stocks Monthly system are definitely worth investigating once you are up to speed with the nuts and bolts of investing.
        </p> Start with a retirement account like a 401(k), if you have access to one, or an IRA.  Use payroll deduction or automatic monthly transfers from your checking account to make contributions.  Invest the account assets in a lifecycle or target date fund.  These are mutual funds where the fund&#039;s management does the work of allocating and diversifying investments for you.  See the webpages listed below for more information.
        </p> Some of the answers you&#039;ve gotten, so far, are ridiculous. <br>
 <br>
First lesson: Don&#039;t take advise from strangers that you have know way of knowing their credentials or motives. <br>
 <br>
Take 6 months to a year &amp; read (at least) a couple of books on basic investing. Doing anything else would be a costly mistake.  &quot;Dummy&quot; series is a good start. <br>
 <br>
Good luck!
        </p> Open a brokerage account at Zecco and drop me a line. <br>
 <br>
I am a Portfolio Manager with over a decade of experience in the Stock Market.
        </p> open an account, fund it, learn about the market, figure what you want to own, buy it, have an exit strategy-why you would sell, and wait. It will go up and down. the market wants to go up but get in slowly. May want to start with ETF. <br>
Have fun
        </p> I dnt know which country you live, but they is often free investment classes around. Read about it, its pretty easy staff really.
        </p> Umm buy some !!! mutual funds are a pretty safe bet
