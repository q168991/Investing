</script><p> this is from another question and is rambling but has some good advice - there are numerous books on this subject. <br>
I personally prefer a personal relationship with human beings and choose to pay yearly fee. <br>
my suggestion is to find a stock or two and a mutual fund or two 5-6 total to track on a routine and daily basis <br>
pick somethings that you have an interest in or knowledge of <br>
I shop at and like whole foods - I can tell by shopping at whole foods routinely what is going on in that store is an example  <br>
mutual funds have sectors <br>
funds are rated as to conservative etc. <br>
never invest money you can not afford to lose outright <br>
start early in life <br>
buy whole shares only and have dividends and gains accrue in a cash or money market account to place at your will in order to average your/the net cost of your position in an investment - this makes for figuring taxes/net costs easier <br>
the idiots guide to building wealth book is a good approach/framework <br>
the &quot;hot tip&quot; in the newspaper and magazine is someone else&#039;s placement the month before <br>
what is an inverse relationship <br>
I do not believe shorting should be legal <br>
good luck   most anything has it&#039;s ups and downs <br>
the indexes appeal mostly to emotion and not necessarily reason and logic if the company is a good company with a good product and good price stay the course <br>
always have enough cash on hand to buy in  when a deal may come around <br>
find an adviser that is older rather than younger and one that offices where the wealthy folks in your community live is my advice <br>
an investment account is better than life insurance when you are young[less likely to die] <br>
when you get your first real job with a salary buy an older used car with cash <br>
and save and invest 1/2 your salary <br>
if you marry live on one salary and pay off the house [buy a house less than you can afford and fix it up some -if one or both of you get fired you can still pay the mortgage and rent out a room to grandma?][once it is paid for you always have a rent home or a fall back home] in less than five years -do not have kids for five years if you do this wisely your are free of debt for life after five years or less <br>
good luck

</script><p> Find an undervalued stock and buy it. Don&#039;t trade too frequently because it will cost you commission. Good luck.
