</script><p> Hi, <br>
 <br>
   Hey!  Do your own homework - it&#039;s safer.  When you follow other people&#039;s advice (OPA) and it fails, what have you learned?  Zip.  Nada.  Zero.  OPA is for suckers.  Don&#039;t fall into that trap. <br>
 <br>
   When you do your own homework even if it turns out to be wrong, you learn from it and get better - it&#039;s called experience. <br>
 <br>
   Investing is like a scientific hypothesis - you hypothesize that based on your investigation and knowledge, this stock should go up and make a profit.  Sometimes your hypothesis is wrong and it&#039;s back to the drawing board. <br>
 <br>
   If I were young, I would be investing in small cap growth mutual funds or stocks.  Go here for excellent low cost advice (http://***aaii***/aaiiportfolios/comme... <br>
 <br>
   Don&#039;t be alarmed at the low cost - it has some of the best financial advice on the Web. <br>
 <br>
     If you have lots of time before retirement  the magic of compound interest will just keep building and building.  It really works and if you keep investing and re-investing your proftis every year, in 10 or 15 years you will be surprised at how it mounts up.  In 30 years you could be a millionaire which probably won&#039;t amount to much in 30 year owing to the the ravages of inflation.  But stocks are a good hedge against inflation. <br>
 <br>
  By that time you may need a money manager  to manage your money - probably before when you reach the $500,000 mark.  Heck!  If you have achieved that much, you probably don&#039;t need a money manager - you are the best judge of where to invest your money by that time. <br>
 <br>
  And that&#039;s the primary reason to keep investing in small cap growth stocks - they will flog inflation to death. <br>
 <br>
   When investing in mutual funds, select the no-load funds only.  Do not invest in mutual funds with a &quot;load&quot;, an up front commission that you have to pay before when they sell you the mutual fund.  Some charge as much as 10% which is a rrip-off.  Many studies have shown that the no-load funds do as well as the load funds and sometimes a lot better. <br>
 <br>
   Look at the AAI Shadow Stock Portfolio.  I would try and emulate that portfolio if you want to invest in stocks.  It was up 25% as of November 2006.  The Vanguard Index fund is only up 14%. <br>
 <br>
   AAII has some of the best financial advisers and the cost is very low.   They have excellent guides and advice. <br>
 <br>
  You may need a broker so go to e-Trade or Scottsdale who have low commission rates. <br>
 <br>
   Do your own due diligence.  Your own ideas are the best.  Do not depend on someone else to select investments for you.  Learn about investing so you don&#039;t have to ask what stocks to invest in.   <br>
 <br>
   Be self reliant.   <br>
 <br>
   Remember what Emerson said:  A foolish consistency is the hobgoblin of little minds, adored by little statesmen and philosophers and divines. With consistency a great soul has simply nothing to do. <br>
 <br>
   Find stocks that have steadily rising net profits (earnings), low debt, and good P/Es, lots of cash, companies buying back their stock.. <br>
 <br>
   What interests you?  Find stocks that pique your interest and passion. <br>
 <br>
  You need fast growing good stocks with good earnings and in good sectors.  You need to learn more about the stock market before you even think about investing in it. <br>
 <br>
  The stocks world is divided into 12 sectors such as energy which chevron belongs to.  It is next to last in the sectors list today. <br>
 <br>
   Technology is numero uno, but things can change in a new york minute, but within the sector, the fastest growing are computer services, not Microsoft.  Then,  Electronic Instruments and controls.  Next is computer storage devices. <br>
 <br>
   The next hot sector is Healthcare, but heed the warning below.  Go here for sectors:  (http://clearstation.etrade***/cgi-bin/I... <br>
 <br>
  The best software is Vector Vest if you can afford it.  It has sector investing. <br>
 <br>
   Here is a free Web site for charting stocks:  (http://***incrediblecharts***/). <br>
 <br>
   First of all, stay away from &quot;professional brokers&quot; and tips coming to you via e-mail or friends and acquaintances.   And tips at Yahoo! Answers.  And e-mail tips.  Do your own due diligence - don&#039;t rely on someone else.  Read Emerson&#039;s essay &quot;Self Reliance. <br>
 <br>
   Hey!  They will say anything to get you to buy their junk.  If it&#039;s too good to be true, it is. <br>
 <br>
   Remember this, they are just sales people trying to sell you what their firm is pushing.  They are not security analysts or financial planners, not even financial advisers.  Trust me, I know from experience that they cannot be trusted especially with a million dollars.  You risk losing it all.  A million dollar account is known as a &quot;whale&quot; and they would love to get their greedy little paws on it and suck it dry.  They just want to make commissions on what they buy and sell for the suckers, err...clients.. <br>

 <br>
   Risk avoidance is the name of the game. <br>
 <br>
   Remember, the harder I work, the luckier I get.   <br>
 <br>
   Penny stocks are highly speculative.  I would avoid the ones under a dollar a share.  For example, Best Buy started at less than $5.  So there are some good companies, but it takes a lot of digging to find the good ones.  You are looking for companies with good earnings, little debt, low capitalization, and good P/Es.  For stocks under $5, very few will meet these requirements. <br>
 <br>
   Stay away from the pharms unless they have patented drugs - do not invest in generic pharms,  no growth there. <br>
 <br>
  Check out which business sectors are the most popular and invest in the companies in those sectors.  The number one, two and three are:  technology, health care, and cyclicals (retail).  These change periodically so keep current. <br>

   Rule #1: The Simple Strategy for Successful Investing in Only 15 Minutes a Week!  by Phil Town .  See his Web site at (http://***ruleoneinvestor***/).  Free sign-up.  I got the book at the library. <br>
 <br>
   Listen.  You don&#039;t have to spend a lot of money on these books - most can be found at your library and those that your library doesn&#039;t have they can usually get from other libraries in your state. <br>
 <br>
   Most of these books talk about stock and mutual fund investing, but for a good introduction to other forms of investing Gerald Appel has a great book called Opportunity Investing - How to Profit When Stock Advance, Stocks decline, Inflation Run Rampant, Prices fall, Oil Prices Hit the Roof and Every Time In Between. <br>
 <br>
   First, Break All the Rules: What the World&#039;s Greatest Managers Do Differently by Marcus Buckingham and Curt Coffman   Not a book on investing, but it&#039;s a nice segue into the next book. <br>
 <br>
   Now, Discover Your Strengths by Marcus Buckingham and Donald O. Clifton  <br>
 <br>
   Go Put Your Strengths to Work: 6 Powerful Steps to Achieve Outstanding Performance by Marcus Buckingham  <br>
 <br>
   Finding your strengths is important when investing.  These books teach you to build on your strengths, what you a good at.  Everyone is good or passionate about  something.  Why not get better at what you are good at? <br>
 <br>
  Another good book is:  Opportunity Investing: How To Profit When Stocks Advance, Stocks Decline, Inflation Runs Rampant, Prices Fall, Oil Prices Hit the Roof, ... and Every Time in Between (Hardcover) <br>
by Gerald Appel <br>
 <br>
   Most mutual funds do not even keep up the the return on the S&amp;P.  That&#039;s like 99% of them. <br>
 <br>
  Vanguard Index funds are a no brainer. <br>
 <br>
   A CD is better than a savings account.  They range from six months to several years.  You cannot touch your money tho until the time limit is up. <br>
 <br>
   Check out this Web site on Direct Investment Plans where you can buy shares directly from companies:  (http://***fool***/School/DRIPs.htm).  Usually no fees and you can buy one share at a time. <br>
 <br>
   Bonds are probably the safest.  But they are not for the young.  You might try a bond fund.  They might return 5 or 6 percent.  At 5% a million would return $50,000 a year - not a bad income.  Remember, you have to pay taxes on the $50,000. <br>
 <br>
   There are also municipal bonds and the income from them is taxfree especially if you buy them in a state that offers them, but they only pay about 3%, but it&#039;s mostly taxfree. <br>
 <br>
   Look into Fidelity sector funds.  Buy the top three, then in six months look how they are doing and if not so hot, select the next three that are best.  Do this for a few years and you will make lots of money. <br>
 <br>

P.S.  This is a life-long learning process.  Reading these books and applying the rules to analyzing stocks that may be good   It takes time.  Be patient and keep reading and listening.  Don&#039;t be a sucker and follow someone elses advice.  Be your own man or woman.  Depend on no one except yourself.  You can only get smarter and stronger that way. <br>
 <br>
P.P.S.  Internet has lots of good stuff, for example (http://stockcharts***/school/doku.php?id=chart_school:technical_indicators:moving_average_conve <br>
Stockcharts*** is very good and their discussion of MACD is one of the best, barring its originator, Gerald Apple, but now we are getting into Technical Analysis and that is not for beginners.  But it is an important factor in finding good stocks that are going up and growing.  Remember, tiny acorns grow into mighty oaks.

        </p> Investing can be very complex, there are many different forms of investing and I think the first thing you need to decide is what investing style best suits you and your long term goals. <br>
The Motley Fool is what i used to get me started they make things make a lot more sense and have services for all the different types of investing. ***fool*** they send you plenty of free advice to give you an idea of the different stratagies of  investing which are basicly advertisemnts but just ignor them atleast until you&#039;ve made a few decisions (then again they have free trails). <br>
There information in strongly inherited from investing great&#039;s such as Peter Lynch, Warren Buffet and Benjamin Graham.  <br>
If you decide to become a active investor (investing in stocks and shares by yourself) at the end of the day it&#039;s your decisions you have to put up with. <br>
Other than that start reading investing books &#039;The Intellegent Investor&#039; by Benjamin Graham  is pricless advice.
        </p> If you make informed decisions and approach your penny stock investments with the same thoroughness that you’d use in your other investments, you too can unlock a whole lot of profit potential. Learn here https://tr.im/moGDt <br>

It’s absolutely true that penny stock investors can make very quick gains. Synutra International, Inc. (NASDAQ: SYUT) is a great example of a penny stock. This dairy-based, nutritional-products company has jumped from a little Bulletin Board operation to a billion dollar corporation. The company finally graduated from Over-the-Counter status to the NASDAQ Stock Market bringing with it 113% gains in less than two months. <br>
 <br>
This happens all the time and it’s how some of the best investors in the world became the richest investors in the world. Buying some shares for pennies on the dollar and selling at $10 or $20 is possibly the fastest way from being a hobby investor to a super investor

 <br>
Oh, and skip anything by Jim Cramer or Robert Kiyosaki. <br>
 <br>
P.S. the new book by Ben Stein looks good but I haven&#039;t picked up a copy yet.
        </p> The basic, first thing you need to know is why do you want to invest in stocks. Are you in for the long haul, or do you want to make a quick buck. Do you want capital gains, or do you want dividends. Or a combination of both. <br>
 <br>
Once you know that, you will know what kind of books to read to educate yourself. <br>
 <br>
And yes, Kiyosaki (Rich Dad Poor Dad) is still a good choice, if only to open your mind up, and for the insight that even if you diversify your stock portfolio, you are still only in stocks!! Secondly, that it is very difficult to invest your way to riches. <br>
 <br>
There are a large number of other investment options out there. <br>
 <br>
Have fun, and be careful.

        </p> I like Yahoo Finance and morningstar***.When picking investments don&#039;t put more than 10% of your money in any one stock.Thats why low cost index mutual funds are best for begining investers.always check the annual fees companies charge try not to pay more than .5% per year.And never invest in mutual funds that charge loads,some as high as 5.75%.Check out a total stock market fund at Vanguard. <br>
Best of luck in your investing, E.B.
        </p> I&#039;m guessing you know Yahoo! Finance, since you&#039;re here. <br>
 <br>
If you want to learn/do technical analysis, stockcharts*** is great!   <br>
 <br>
Another good one is barchart***, it has both technical and fundamental info.  <br>

Both have both free and subscriber options. <br>
 <br>
You can also experiment for free with a 40 stock portfolio of picks at clearstation***, which is tied to etrade. <br>

Books I have learned from: <br>
 <br>
Beginners should read:  Andrew Tobias, The Only Investment Guide You&#039;ll Ever Need <br>
 <br>
Everyone should read: Benjamin Graham, The Intelligent Investor -- get the new edition with notes by Jason Zweig <br>
 <br>
Burton Malkiel, A Random Walk Down Wall Street (not that I totally believe the efficient market hypothesis, but it&#039;ll make you take big claims with a grain of salt) <br>
 <br>
Philip Fisher, Common Stocks <br>
 <br>
Anything by Peter Lynch -- start with One Up On Wall Street <br>
 <br>
Almost every book about Buffett.  Start with The Essays of Warren Buffett or The Warren Buffet Way or Buffettology.  Also books by his partner Charlie Munger. <br>
 <br>
Joel Greenblatt, The Little Book that Beat the Market <br>
Joel Greenblatt, You Can Be a Stock Market Genius <br>
 <br>
Pat Dorsey, The Five Rules for Successful Stock Investing <br>
David &amp; Tom Gardner, The Motley Fool Investment Guide <br>
 <br>
Thomas Stanley, the Millionaire Next Door, isn&#039;t about stocks but is about attitudes towards money and how the rich aren&#039;t really like how they&#039;re pictured in Hollywood. <br>
 <br>
The World Is Flat (new edition) by Thomas Friedman to give you a little global context and whiff of the future. <br>
 <br>
Oh, and skip anything by Jim Cramer or Robert Kiyosaki. <br>
 <br>
P.S. the new book by Ben Stein looks good but I haven&#039;t picked up a copy yet.
        </p> The basic, first thing you need to know is why do you want to invest in stocks. Are you in for the long haul, or do you want to make a quick buck. Do you want capital gains, or do you want dividends. Or a combination of both. <br>
 <br>
Once you know that, you will know what kind of books to read to educate yourself. <br>
 <br>
And yes, Kiyosaki (Rich Dad Poor Dad) is still a good choice, if only to open your mind up, and for the insight that even if you diversify your stock portfolio, you are still only in stocks!! Secondly, that it is very difficult to invest your way to riches. <br>
 <br>
There are a large number of other investment options out there. <br>
 <br>
Have fun, and be careful.

        </p> I like Yahoo Finance and morningstar***.When picking investments don&#039;t put more than 10% of your money in any one stock.Thats why low cost index mutual funds are best for begining investers.always check the annual fees companies charge try not to pay more than .5% per year.And never invest in mutual funds that charge loads,some as high as 5.75%.Check out a total stock market fund at Vanguard. <br>
Best of luck in your investing, E.B.

i have attended a lot of seminars, read counless books on forex trading and it all cost me thousands of dollars. the worst thing was i blew up my first account. after that i opened another account and the same thing happened again. i started to wonder why i couldn,t make any money in forex trading. at first i thought i knew everything about trading. finally i found that the main problem i have was i did not have the right mental in trading. as we know that psychology has great impact on our trading result. apart from psychology issue, there is another problem that we have to address. they are money management, market analysis, and entry/exit rules. to me money management is important in trading. i opened another account and start to trade profitably after i learnt from my past mistake. i don&#039;t trade emotionally anymore.  <br>
if you are serious about trading you need to address your weakness and try to fix it. no forex guru can make you Professional trader unless you want to learn from your mistake.
