<h1>Best stock market investing books for beginners?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am 18 and just graduated and will start college in a year from now. I am taking a year off to work and save money for college. I also want to invest in the stock market. My dad is helping me. But I&amp;#39;d like to read a book on beginning trading in the stock market. I would like to buy mutual funds as well as stocks. So what book should I buy to learn about the stock market and investing for beginners like me?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Unfortunately, there are many books out there that make great reading, but promote investment systems that don&#039;t work.  Finding good investment books is difficult. <br>
  <br>
One excellent book is Burton Malkiel&#039;s &quot;A Random Walk down Wall Street.&quot;  It discusses how to build a safe, balanced portfolio of stocks.  You can find it in most libraries. <br>
  <br>
Other good books are: <br>
 <br>
The Bogleheads&#039; Guide to Investing  <br>
The Investor&#039;s Manifesto: Preparing for Prosperity, Armageddon, and Everything in Between  <br>
The Four Pillars of Investing: Lessons for Building a Winning Portfolio  <br>
The Only Guide to a Winning Investment Strategy You&#039;ll Ever Need: The Way Smart Money Invests Today  <br>
The New Coffeehouse Investor: How to Build Wealth, Ignore Wall Street, and Get on with Your Life

        </p> How can you cash in on the potential growth that penny stocks have to offer? Learn here https://tr.im/tradepennystocks  <br>
 <br>
There are three things you&#039;ll want to look for when picking a penny stock to make sure that you don&#039;t get penny stuck: Underlying business, financials, and footnotes. <br>
 <br>
When it comes to penny stocks, a company&#039;s underlying business is even more important than it is in exchange-traded stocks. That&#039;s because the penny stock world is home to &quot;shell&quot; companies that are legally incorporated, but don&#039;t have any business operations
        </p> Good plan.  Start with _Dummies Guide to Stock Market Investing_ or _Idiots Guide to Stock Market Investing_--it doesn&#039;t really matter which.  What matters is that you learn about all the basics.
        </p> Trading binary options online is not as complicated as many people think it is. Read here https://tr.im/kZVHk <br>
 <br>
You don’t have to be an economics expert in order to make money by trading binary options. The charts allow you to predict the future course of an asset by finding patterns in its past price movements, and after all this what we need to win a binary trade. <br>
 <br>
Don&#039;t be intimidated by the charts, actually they are not that hard to read and understand. Strategies that are based on reading and analyzing charts are part of the technical analysis area.
        </p> Read Market Wizards. Great book. And also, turtle traders. <br>
Enjoy <br>
