</script><p> Hi Anisha, <br>
I understand your urge to invest. But I am afraid you will have to wait for that. <br>
To invest in stock market, you will require a PAN card. And to get your PAN card, you must be at least 18. <br>
All the best.

They shall help you and clarify you and besides you may also counter question regardless of you favor to understand. As a clean participant do no longer initiate with more beneficial than Rs. 10, 000/-. adventure makes a adult males proper. interior six months or on the most in a year you&#039;d be in a position of play on your own.
