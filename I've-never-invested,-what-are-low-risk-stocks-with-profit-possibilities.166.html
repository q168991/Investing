 <br>
Low risk stocks are good investment but so are mutual funds and Exchange Traded Fund. <br>
 <br>
You can go to the MSN.Money website it has an entire section on mutual funds, EFTs and top rated stocks.  <br>
 <br>
MSN Money also has a list of their top ten stocks.  These stock selections have excellent track records and for the most part are all low risk <br>
 <br>
Read about the various funds, EFTs and in doing so you will be getting investment ideas and at the same time educating yourself about investing. <br>
 <br>
And remember, keeping you money in a bank or bank product is not investing
        </p> Good low risk investments are things that humans use every day, something that will never go out of fashion, something that we need to survive. Things like Major food corporations (Mcdonalds, Starbucks, Whole foods, etc), Oil companies (BP, Shell, etc), Even Water companies (Every source of water these days is owned by a company). Those are the best ways to invest small, and play it safe. Once you get the groove of those, maybe try investing in some pharmaceutical companies.. if you do your research you can really cash in on those!
        </p> With stocks its best to invest in index mutual or exchange traded funds--these are mutual funds that track lists of stocks, for example the S&amp;P 500, a list of the 500 biggest stocks in the US. If you buy an exchange traded fund that follows the S&amp;P 500 you&#039;ll effectively hold stock in 500 large companies, which is a lot safer than owning indiviudal stocks (one company may collapse, but 500 aren&#039;t going to.)
        </p> The best list of possible investments I&#039;ve used this year came from sources at these two websites: <br>
