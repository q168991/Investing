<h1>Physical Gold investing 101?</h1>
<div class="answer">Hello all

I&amp;#39;m interested in beginning to invest in physical gold. It seems that the American Eagle gold bullion is the most recognizable and most popular coin. I&amp;#39;m interested in buying 1-10oz pieces of gold. 

Since i don&amp;#39;t know much about Gold bullion i like the fact that the American Eagle coins are backed by the government for purity standards. Can i buy these coins straight from the government or will i have to buy from a coin dealer? Is there usually a big mark up at a dealer? If so, how much is the standard mark up.

If anyone can give me any advice on what type of coins to look for and where to purchase coins please let me know.

Thanks<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> 1 oz. gold bullion coins are the U.S. Eagle, U.S. Buffalo, Canadian Maple Leaf and S.A. Krugerrand. All of these coins are recognized worldwide for maintaining the highest purity standards, and all contain exactly 1 troy ounce of pure gold. Of these only the Canadian Maple Leaf is pure 24K gold. The others (including the U.S. coins) are 22K, including a copper alloy to improve mechanical strength and handling characteristics of the coins. But all the above coins contain exactly one troy ounce of pure gold.  <br>
 <br>
Buy these from a reputable gold bullion dealer such as Kitco. You should be paying no more than about 3% above spot, plus shipping and insurance, approximately $100 for an order that size, give or take. See ref below. PS: I don&#039;t work for Kitco or have any financial interest in them whatsoever. I provide them simply as an example of a long established reputable dealer in precious metals.  <br>
 <br>
Good luck in your investing!

I think the discussion is about whether you want to get into collecting coins with numismatic value along with their purity or whether they have scratches, etc. The premium for a coin fluctuates as well as the price of the metal. <br>
 <br>
Or whether you want to invest in physical bulk metal for meltdown value. You will always know what these rounds and bars are worth as pure metal without appraisal.
        </p> American Eagles are tax-advantaged for Americans.  If you don&#039;t need this tax advnatge they are too expensive.
