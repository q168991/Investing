</script><p> In theory, yes. <br>
 <br>
Gold has been up on a monthly chart since late 2005, though... that&#039;s a long period of uptrend.  Why would you think that will end anytime soon?

</script><p> The security of treasury bonds depends upon the creditworthiness of the U.S. government. If it turns out that the US government can&#039;t, in fact, pay off its debts (without vast inflation, which would amount to a de facto default, since the dollars they use to pay interest payments would become almost worthless), then gold may turn out to be more secure.  For the past 11 years, gold has increased in value a great deal faster than any bonds. But past performance is always a poor guide to future performance.  For these reasons, no one really knows for sure whether treasury bonds are more secure than gold--we can&#039;t predict the future. In general, people who buy gold are making a bet that our economy is heading for a crisis even greater than the &quot;great recession.&quot; <br>
 <br>
If inflation kicks in, as it must sooner or later, then bond prices could plummet, even if the interest payments continue. <br>
 <br>
On the other hand, the security of gold depends solely on the willingness of others to pay a price equal to or greater than the price you paid in buying the gold. If a substantial number of gold owners decide that gold is over-valued (just as home buyers in 2008-9 decided that homes were over-valued), then gold prices could plummet.  <br>
 <br>
Over the long term, historically, the best hedge against inflation has been stocks.
        </p> If you think that the FED might inflate the dollar if there is going to be a depression or such in the future your bonds will be worthless. So in that case it is definitely not safe. Than gold is your choice. <br>
 <br>
If you think that there will be low inflation for the years to come, you are probably much better off owning bonds. <br>
 <br>
So it is a matter of what you think about the economy. I think there will be really bad times within the coming years and would definitely own some gold just as an insurance. <br>
 <br>
Any person who wants a diversified portfolio, a.k.a a well-balanced healthy portfolio, should always own gold! It has been a trustworthy holder of value for mankind for thousands of years and will probably be that for the remaining of yours and my life. It may not always have been the best investment, but that is not what you are primarily looking at when buying gold.
        </p> People have been buying bonds.   When the credit rating downgrade occurred, the bond yield went down, that was because people were dumping stock and buying Treasury bonds.   The bond yield is still lower than it was before the debt ceiling deadline and they haven&#039;t done any QE so it&#039;s people buying the bonds.   A bond gives you a defined return with only the possibility of a default whereas gold gives you a probability distribution of returns so as a counterweight to equity investments in a portfolio, bonds are more useful to manage risk than gold is, however the currency has also been devaluing so that flat return that bonds are giving you is starting to flatten more or even slope down a little. <br>
 <br>
The US dollar has been a modern fiat currency since 1972, the nonsense about bonds  being backed by gold that another poster mentioned is just nonsense.   It&#039;s backed by the good faith of the country, nothing more, nothing less.
        </p> Yes, but they are related together as well. <br>
 <br>
In fact, treasuries and gold almost move in the same direction. When Treasuries go up, Gold goes up, and Stocks move down. This indicates the economy is suffering and people are dumping stocks which is more risky, and buy safe havens. Precious metals including Gold is a safe haven. Treasury bonds are  safe as well. But when people buys treasuries, the yields (or interest rates) paid to investor gets lower.  <br>
Treasuries Go up, Yield Goes down, Less return to Investor. <br>
Gold goes Up, means more return for investor. <br>
So, for experienced person, whenever the economy is suffering, gold and treasuries are preferred.  <br>
But if the economy is doing well, people are going to sell gold making its price going down, and put their money in equity markets including stocks. This will give them better return represented in dividends payment and positive movement of the shares. <br>
 <br>
So, when S&amp;P lower the grade of U.S., people were rushing to buy gold and treasuries enhancing them. <br>
That&#039;s a big sign that the economy is not improving as expected.
        </p> Treasuries are paying virtually zero. Gold has gone up 20% in the past month or so. The US government credit rating has just been downgraded and our idiot politicians have responded to the crisis by going on vacation.  <br>
 <br>
Which do you think is better?
        </p> The return on gold has been greater in recent times than the return on Treasuries. But, as you correctly identify, Treasuries are more secure than buying gold. So it&#039;s a trade off: <br>
 <br>
Buy gold = greater returns, greater risks. <br>
Buy Treasuries = less returns, less risks.
        </p> Gold is world wide market but US bond is only through US. If US crises rise more than US bond have no value and also gold price go hike very fast.
        </p> They give out more bonds than actual physical gold available. Why do you think they have all these commercials to sell your gold?
