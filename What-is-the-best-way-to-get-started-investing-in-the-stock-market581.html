        </p> Wow... reading the prior 6 answers reminds me just how ignorant everyone is to this.  Honestly the best way to get started in the stock market with little capital is... open a brokerage account (like etrade)  at 18 with &#039;very little capital&#039; as you put it, i assume you have 100-5000 right?  So don&#039;t do a virtual thing and waste your time.  What you need to do is find a company you admire like a target, google, starbucks or whatever and just invest.  People will tell you, do fundamentals or technicals, you know, do your homework, but the sad truth about the market is that it&#039;s a legalized gambling and pyramid scheme.  The last to enter are the ones making the early investors RICH.  Who are the early investors...well it&#039;s those who buy on the primary market.  What is that you ask?  It&#039;s the investment bankers who offer up initial stock offerings to their buddies, family members, and high power investors.  Us regular folks are limited to the secondary market.  So when you see google go from 520 to 750 in 60 days... and try to invest at 749... you are screwed, cuz you&#039;re at the bottom of the pyramid scheme.  Whatever i&#039;m rambling.  But you get the point i hope.  Just invest, but don&#039;t follow the crowd.  Pick a cool product or company and go with your gut.
        </p> Investing in the stock market is a great way to make money online. however, if you don&#039;t know what you are doing, you can lose more than you earn. Before you start, learn some stock market basics, like selecting the right stock to trade, timing your entry and exits from trades, and risk management.
        </p> There are many good websites with introduction to investing.  Motley Fool @ fool*** is a good place to start.  Also your local library I&#039;m sure has many books on investing. <br>
 <br>
For broad diversity you could by any of the Total Stock Market index funds.  It owns every stock in the U.S..  Electronically traded funds can also be broadly diversified.  Ticker SPY owns the Standard &amp; Poor&#039;s Index.   <br>
 <br>
Be wary of high fees because they decrease your returns.   <br>
 <br>
Start with a discount broker like Charles Schwab.  They ususally have low account minimums and lower commissions than the big brokers.
        </p> Virtual exchange sounds good. Read economic periodicals. And if you choose to invest now, go with a very conservative fund. The market is tanking currently.
        </p> Chris is right on. As a young, new investor, start out with a very inexpensive investment plan, put money in on a regular basis, and when you have a sizeable amount (say 10-20k) look into alternative ways to invest - such as options. They can greatly increase your income, but only if traded correctly. (Trade them incorrectly and you can lose your money just as fast) <br>
 <br>
Also, no-brainer stocks you can try are called ETFs. They are funds that own an array of stocks that comprise indexes - such as QQQQ.  <br>
 <br>
Best of luck!
        </p> Mutual funds that are professionally managed are a good place to start out.  You get in with a small amount, and your money is automatically diversified.  Until you know the markets, go with a good reputable fund.
        </p> Check out mutual fund companies.  Like T Rowe Price.
