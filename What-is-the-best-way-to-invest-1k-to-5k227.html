</script><p> Step one determine your &quot;time horizon&quot; <br>
 <br>
How long can you invest the money before you will need to touch it? <br>
 <br>
&lt;10 years or more than 10 years? <br>
 <br>
If your answer is less than 10 years talk to your banker about how to buy a CD (certificate of deposit).  You can also buy US government bonds if they offer higher rates.  Go to http://***treasurydirect.gov/ to buy US government bonds directly from the US government. <br>
 <br>
If your answer is greater than 10 years, invest in stocks, mutual funds are the easiest at first.  Go to Vanguard&#039;s website:  https://personal.vanguard***/us/home?fr... and ask them about how to invest in their total stock market index mutual fund.  you can call: 877-662-7447 to reach them. <br>
 <br>
Once you build up to $50,000 talk to a financial advisor.  A good financial advisor will help you grow and protect your savings more efficiently.  A bad financial advisor will overcharge you with hidden fees and will lose large amounts of your savings.  Good luck!
