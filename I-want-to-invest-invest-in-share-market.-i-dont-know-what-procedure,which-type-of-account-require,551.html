        To invest in shares , you do not need a broker or an agent these days. You can invest in  primary markets, buy and sell in secondary market yourself. For that you have to open a Demat (dematerialisation) account.   <br>
You can open this account in a bank like SBI, Indian bank or ICICI and trade online sitting in front of any computer with an internet connection.  You should have a savings bank account and a cheque book , probably. If you have a savings account in any bank, go and talk to them. <br>
  Or if you do not have time for and access to  an internet connection , you can open a demat account in brokering agencies like India infoline, Motilal oswal or anand rathi etc. You can do trading by either an internet connection or by phone. <br>
 <br>
You will require a PAN card and other address proof etc. <br>
You will have to maintain a minimum balance as well. <br>
  <br>
After you have opened one such account you can deposit your money in your  account , login to your demat account using a username and a password, transfer money from SB account to demat account and trade in shares. <br>
It is that simple, <br>
I am trading from my ICICI bank account using a ICICI demat account. It is hassle-free and one-click operation. No running around with papers. <br>
 <br>
I am also making good money.  <br>
 <br>
One piece of advice: Do not get carried away. Invest your money in good &#039;A&#039; group stocks. Do not put all your money at once. Wait and slowly buy shares like SBI ,Infosys, L&amp;T and REliance Tata etc whenever the market slumps to 15000 points or so.  <br>
Wait for a few months till the indices rise. You can sell a part of your holdings and make money , or better still , wait even longer till you get bonus shares and dividends. This is the better option. <br>
