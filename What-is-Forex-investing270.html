</script><p> Foreign exchange is changing one currency for another as they fluctuate in value against each other. <br>
 <br>
Here&#039;s the simplest example I can give you.  All the numbers in this example are completely made up, and do not indicate real exchange rates.  Here we go: <br>
 <br>
Imagine that you&#039;re in San Diego, ready to cross the border into Mexico for a day trip.  You have $10 US in your pocket, and must change your money for Mexican pesos at the border.  The current exchange rate is 5 pesos per dollar.  So you end up with 50 pesos in your pocket. <br>
 <br>
You stroll around for an hour, don&#039;t buy anything, and decide to cross the border back into the United States.  Once you get back however, the exchange rate for dollars/pesos has changed.  It is no longer 5 pesos to the dollar.  Instead, it is now 2.5 pesos to the dollar.  Bad news, right?  Maybe not. <br>
 <br>
Remember that you have 50 pesos in your pocket to change back into US dollars.  Now, every 2.5 pesos are worth $1.  Therefore, 50 pesos divided by 2.5 = $20.  You get $20 back for the 50 pesos. <br>
 <br>
You started out with $10, and ended up with $20.  That&#039;s how foreign exchange works. <br>
 <br>
Let me quickly add that the example I just gave you is an extreme one.  You won&#039;t ever double your money in one transaction like this. <br>
 <br>
However, although the numbers are exaggerated, this is exactly how foreign exchange works.  And, via the internet, you don&#039;t actually have to cross any international borders.  You just do it online from home.   <br>
 <br>
And as for the &quot;Forex For Dummies&quot; book, don&#039;t bother.  I read several books when I first started out, and of all those books, the For Dummies book is the one that I found to be least informative, by far.  It had kind of a just-thrown-together feel to me.   <br>
 <br>
And DON&#039;T pay someone thousands of dollars to learn their system.  If their system worked as well as they will tell you that it does, they wouldn&#039;t need so much money from you, would they.  They&#039;re just scam artists. <br>
 <br>
If you email me, I can give you some general pointers.  Ultimately though, you will develop your own trading techniques that will be unique to you. <br>
 <br>
Realize that this is not an easy market to learn.  If you do learn it though, you&#039;ll make a lot of money from it. <br>
 <br>
Good luck to you.

</script><p> To my knowledge, Forex is the foreign currency exchange market. It is open 5 days a week, 24 hours a day, so some investors prefer that over traditional stock and bond market because of the 24 hour possibilities. You are basically trading currency instead of stocks.  I don&#039;t know much about actually doing the trading, since I deal mainly in stocks and a small amount in bonds, but the concept is fairly the same. There are several good books out there to give you more detail. The &quot;For Dummies&quot; series have been especially helpful for someone starting out, and I amsure there is probably a Forex book for dummies out there.  That book will give you sources of websites for brokers, things to look for, explain how currency is traded etc. It&#039;s not the definitive source for information, but a good start for someone just starting out.
        </p> You can learn to trade Forex on DEMO accounts. Read a lot about Forex and its workings before you do real trades. You can go through websites and learn more on Forex.
