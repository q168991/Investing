Only 2 of your funds i.e. Birla Sun Life Frontline equity and HDFC TOP 200 has given some returns. All the others have given almost zero returns. So instead of investing in so many schemes if you had kept in 1 fixed deposit, then you would have got more profit. <br>
 <br>
Please don’t feel bad. You are obviously a responsible person. As I can see that you have tried to invest carefully. <br>
 <br>
The flaw in your plan is that you think that mutual fund are a good form of investment. They are NOT. <br>
 <br>
I have also had my money stuck in it for long time.. I even lost some…and then I started investing directly in shares. And frankly there is no comparison, I am earning great profits.. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
People create a lot of hype about the danger in investing in shares, but I have not found it risky or difficult. It is neither difficult nor time taking to figure out how to invest successfully in shares. <br>
 <br>
You can try out this Free Ecourse given in this link http://***invest-in-shares-in-9minute***/shares-for-dummies.html , it is really very good. It is about 50 pages of very useful info. You really get to build a solid foundation of information about the share market. <br>
 <br>
And you can check out the investment strategy given in this page. <br>
http://***invest-in-shares-in-9minute***/shares-for-beginners.html <br>
 <br>
This strategy tells about how common investors can invest based on their own judgment spending just 10 minutes a day and get 40 percent annual returns consistently.

 <br>
Do an systematic transfer plan from ICICI Focused Equity Fund to ICICI Infra for amt say 5K <br>
 <br>
and also an systematic transfer plan from Kotak Indo World Infra to Kotak 30 and Kotak Opportunites ( both wit growth options ) <br>
 <br>
Also do an systematic transfer plan from Reliance Natural Resources to Reliance Regular savings fund for 2K <br>
