<h1>How do I get started investing in stock index funds without paying those high initial investment minimums?</h1>
<div class="answer">Fidelity&amp;#39;s minimum for an IRA is $2500. I&amp;#39;d like to invest in three index funds. I have $4500 to invest. Can I invest 2500 in the first fund, then withdraw 1500 leaving 1000 in, invest 2500 in the second,then withdraw 1500,  so this leaves me with 2500 in hand to invest in the third. Then even everything out so I have equal amounts in each. Please help I&amp;#39;d like to get started soon but can this work. Thanks in advance for your answers<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Very easily.  You can invest in the exchange traded versions.  Buy as few as one share if you want.  They are called index ETFs.  Here is a link that will tell you all about them. <br>

</script><p> i would also consider the etf&#039;s.  especially since the minimums on index funds is actually 10k.  Downside of the etf for 4500$ is that the  commissions will be 19.95 getting in and out.  The only index fund with a 2500 minimum is the four in one index fund and that is only in ira&#039;s.  its  a combo of sp500, extended market, international, and bond fund.  they are arranged in an aggressive growth asset mix.  probably not what you were looking for but i would check it out...
