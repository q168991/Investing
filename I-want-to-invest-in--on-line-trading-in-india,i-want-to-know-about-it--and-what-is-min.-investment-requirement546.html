</script><p> Top 10 Scrips to INVEST in 2008 when the Indian Stock Markets fall: <br>
 <br>
Reliance Industries (RELIANCE), Oil &amp; Natural Gas Corporation (ONGC), NTPC, Bharti Airtel (BHARTIARTL), State Bank of India (SBIN), Larsen &amp; Toubro (LT), Bharat Heavy Electricals (BHEL), Steel Authority of India (SAIL), Tata Consultancy Services (TCS) and Housing Development Finance Corporation (HDFC). <br>
 <br>
First of all, you have to open 3 Accounts to buy / sell Equity shares from the Indian Stock Market. <br>
 <br>
•	Savings Bank Account (Preferably with HDFC Bank / ICICI Bank / Axis Bank / IDBI Bank), <br>
•	Demat Account    and <br>
•	Share Trading Account. <br>
 <br>
Savings Bank Account: Savings Bank accounts are accounts maintained by banks that pay interest but cannot be used directly as money (by, for example, writing a cheque). These accounts let customers set aside a portion of their liquid assets that could be used to make purchases while earning a monetary return. All savings accounts offer itemized lists of all financial transactions, traditionally through a bank passbook, but also through a bank statement. <br>
 <br>
Demat Account: In India, a demat account, the abbreviation for dematerialized account, is a type of banking account which dematerializes paper-based physical stock (equity) shares. The dematerialized account is used to avoid holding physical equity shares: the equity shares are bought and sold through a stock broker. <br>
 <br>
This account is popular in India. The Securities and Exchange Board of India (SEBI) mandates a demat account for equity share trading even One equity share. As of April 2006, it became mandatory that any person holding a demat account should posses an Income Tax Permanent Account Number (PAN), and the deadline for submission of PAN details to the depository lapsed on January 2007. <br>
 <br>
Procedure: <br>
 <br>
1. Fill demat request form (DRF) (obtained from a depository participant or DP with whom your depository account is opened). <br>
2. Deface the equity share certificate(s) you want to dematerialize by writing across Surrendered for dematerialization. <br>
3. Submit the DRF &amp; equity share certificate(s) to DP. DP would forward them to the issuer / their R&amp;T Agent. <br>
4. After dematerialization, your depository account with your DP would be credited with the dematerialized securities. <br>
 <br>
The benefits: <br>
 <br>
- A safe and convenient way to hold securities; <br>
- Immediate transfer of securities; <br>
- No stamp duty on transfer of securities; <br>
- Elimination of risks associated with physical equity share certificates such as bad delivery, fake securities, delays, thefts etc; <br>
- Reduction in paperwork involved in transfer of securities; <br>
- Reduction in transaction cost; <br>
- No odd lot problem, even one equity share can be sold; <br>
- Nomination facility; <br>
- Change in address recorded with DP gets registered with all companies in which investor holds securities electronically eliminating the need to correspond with each of them separately; <br>
- Transmission of securities is done by DP eliminating correspondence with companies; <br>
- Automatic credit into demat account of equity shares, arising out of bonus/split/consolidation/merger etc. <br>
- Holding investments in equity and debt instruments in a single account. <br>
 <br>
Required Documents: <br>
 <br>
The extent of documentation required to open a demat account may vary according to your relationship with the institution. If you plan to open a demat account with a bank, a savings account holder has an edge over the non-account holder. In fact, banks usually offer additional incentives to customers who open a demat account with them. Along with the application form, your photographs (with co-applicants) and proof of identity/residence/date of birth have to be submitted. The DPs also ask for a DP-client agreement to be executed on non-judicial stamp paper. Here is a broad list (you won’t need all of them though): <br>
Income tax PAN card / Voter’s ID / Passport / Ration card / Driver’s license / Photo credit card / Employee ID card / Bank attestation / Income Tax returns / Electricity bill / Landline phone bill. <br>
 <br>
While they only ask for photocopies of the documents, they will need the originals for verification. You will have to submit 8 passport size photographs on which you sign across. <br>
 <br>
Share Trading Account: An Account which is used to purchase / sell of equity shares through the broker (Like http://***icicidirect*** / http://***hdfcsec*** / http://***indiainfoline*** / http://***reliancemoney*** / http://***axisbank*** / http://***idbi*** ).

</script><p> If you are new, do not try to do brain surgery. First learn, then start crawling, and then you can run. Right now, if you have funds, park it in a mutual fund starting with Rs 2500, start putting $1000 per month in a SIP program of the same fund, and then start reading 100 pages a day on the stock market. You are so far from where you need to be, that this advice will save you a min of Rs 1L over the next 6 months, assuming you were going to invest Rs 5L total in the next 6 months. Saving 20% of your capital is a BIG RETURN I am giving you. It is for the thousands of people that are in your category, do not have motivation like you do to ask questions, and will not have the resources (time, computer, knowledge, skills, guidance and again motivation) that I am GOING TO OPEN MY MONEY MANAGEMENT BUSINESS. I am going to open it for min of Rs 5L investment amounts with investments in good quality stocks with fundamental and technical analysis, ETFs, and Mutual Funds. GL KKP
        </p> To start with open a Dmat account . It can coat from 750 Rs with Reliance Money to some extra with others . After that what ever amount you want to invest ! <br>

 <br>
How to start to open a Demat account? <br>
You have to approach a DP to open a Demat account. Most banks are DP participants so you may approach them. <br>
To have latest list of registered DP please visit websites ***nsdl.co.in and ***cdslindia***. <br>
A broker and a DP are two different people. A broker is a member of the stock exchange, who buys and sells stocks on his behalf and also on behalf of his customers.. <br>
 <br>
Following are the documents required to open Demat account. <br>
When you approach any DP, you will be guided through the formalities of opening an account. The DP will ask to provide some documents as proof of your identity and address. <br>
Below is a list but you may not require all of them. <br>
PAN card, Voter&#039;s ID, Passport, Ration card, Driver&#039;s license, Photo credit card <br>
Employee ID card, IT returns, Electricity/ Landline phone bill
        </p> It&#039;s gr8 move. Few people already adviced u on the opening a/c procedure and every thing, i am not going to repeat. Just  gain more knowledge abt stock market. Don&#039;t take any broker advice. Invest only in Blue Chip companies. Don&#039;t put eggs in 1 basket, diversify, Wish u all the best.
