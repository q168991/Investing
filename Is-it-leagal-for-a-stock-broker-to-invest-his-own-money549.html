</script><p> I think you&#039;re confused about the difference between a stock broker and an investment advisor. I broker just acts on what you tell them to do, or that they can convince you to do. They dont invest your money for you with the intent of beating the market, merely filling their pockets with commissions. They have no fiduciary responsibility, although they may have with the financial reform bill soon. But I dont think it made into the bill. Investment advisors have a fiduciary responsibility to act in their clients best interests. And what they advise depends on the clients risk tolerance and their goals and objectives. Not just beating an index. But investing with someone who has more resources available to them and that you can hold legally responsible seems to me to be a good reason to use one. Assuming you have a large enough portfolio to make the cost worthwhile
        </p> Yes, and most of them have stock investments. They have an advantage over other investors because they earn their own commission. They also get information before other investors. They are not supposed to take advantage of the market by putting their investment ahead of clients&#039;, but this is often abused.
        </p> Yes, the caveat being that his money cannot be put ahead of client interests. For example, if a client comes in to buy lets say IBM, he cannot front run the client and buy IBM in his own account.  <br>
 <br>
At big brokerage houses stock brokers have to declare what they want to buy and sell to a compliance officer before they are allowed to buy/sell stocks in their own account.
        </p> Yes as long as it is not commingled with the clients money in any way
        </p> yes he can as long as its not with his company because then he can change it and steal money
        </p> sure , of course
