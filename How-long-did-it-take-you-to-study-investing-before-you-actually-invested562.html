</script><p> I was invested in mutual funds for several years prior to taking a fling at individual stocks. During that time, I studied the prospectus of each fund, examining closely each of the top ten holdings within each fund as are commonly listed for all to see. I went to corporate websites and then compared notes defining a particular holding to sister companies that were publicly traded. What I found were glaring discrepancies in terms of performance as evidenced by their balance sheets and managerial styles. <br>
 <br>
In time I was invited to write for Marketwatch (CBSMarketwatch at that time) and then was picked up by a Houston energy company to head up its investor relations division. I took the latter position as it enabled me to access the tutelage of both the President and Chairman of the company. This has paid off immensely. From there it was sponsorship enabling me to become a certified money-losing adviser (LOL). Truth be told, I don&#039;t ever expect to stop learning and frankly, there&#039;s much more to be learned than I&#039;ve gained thus far. <br>
 <br>
This is the most exciting field for me, no question about it. Every day is a blessing---full of excitement and filled with gains and also some losses---but at least I get to live it my way without apology or resentments or regret. <br>

</script><p> I actually started investing without any study. I began with about $1000 and signed up for this website called prophetalerts***. they charged me $35 (after i used $15off coupon BM15OFF) and what they do for me is pick stocks which make you quick 5-10% gain AND at same time, they teach you strategies about how to trade. So far, i have learned a ton and have actually made good money too :)
        </p> I worked in the Financial Services industry for many years and thought I understood investing. On a business trip I read Wm Bernstein&#039;s Four Pillars of Investing and then the Boglehead&#039;s Guide to Investing.  They changed my outlook on stocks, Financial Advisors/Brokers and mutual funds.  <br>
 <br>
The later book is written in easy to understand language and doesn&#039;t tout get rich quick strategies. I strongly recommend that you read it before embarking on any investment plan. I have included a good web site for advice and other readings <br>
 <br>
Good Luck
        </p> I don&#039;t think that I studied in a structured way.. I must have read dribs and drabs in books, but mostly I checked newspapers (that was before the www was big)  I learned to read the financial section, watched it, requested mutual fund literature, and started w/the mutual funds.  Later, I got a webtv settop box a good whiles before getting a windows friendly computer.  I set up an Etrade account and dabbled w/trading.  Before having a good computer system, I used touchtone trading via telephone (w/o broker assistance).  Later I moved onto online trading.
        </p> You can make good money like me with this binary option signal software ( http://forexsignal.kyma.info ) Binary options trading has always been popular, however, this investment fad globally exploded around 2008. Originally known as digital options, binary or the name &quot;two values&quot; was added to give a simpler explanation for trading options. Binary is defined as two values or up and down movements. Binaries rely on underlying assets or derivatives. You can trade in commodities, the forex (foreign exchange market), commodities as well as stock indices.
        </p> I actually started investing before I started studying.  Probably not the smartest way to do it, but it seems if you have money on the table then the lessons become clearer.
        </p> I&#039;ve been investing for about 5 years. <br>
I don&#039;t remember every studying. <br>
I buy stocks, etf&#039;s, and cd&#039;s - no treasuries or munis. <br>
