</script><p> Sometime I think people just do not open their eyes. Why every time when unemployment reports and other reports come out the stocks either go up or down? This is a controlled investment and I really do not see any use of investing into this type of investment I will continue to invest in CDs and continue to add and build by doing my normal savings routine. I work to hard to trust a person with my money and just risk throwing it away. Investment firms charge an annual fee and get rich no matter if you make money or lose money. Think about it nobody in this world care about another person well being, its all about greed and money. God Bless
        </p> Investment is about supply and demand, buyers and sellers, fear and greed. You just got to guess right. Are the buyers or the sellers right (in the short or long term)? Is the asset at or near fair value? Maybe read about the Dutch Tulip market.
        </p> Investment is about putting your money in the stock market and watching it whittle away to nothing because of Obama.
