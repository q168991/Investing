 <br>
Anything else means risk. <br>
 <br>
Best profit... find the next IPO of a company that will grow like Microsoft did.  Good luck... 80% chance of losing money when trying to do that.  15% chance break even 4.95% chance of barely beating the CD.

 <br>
You won&#039;t get far buying property in San Jose with only 10k. <br>
 <br>
as for companies you should talk to an investment broker. <br>
 <br>
I don know of a native of San Jose who could use a loan though... ;p <br>
 <br>
Remember Profit is never a guarantee especially in the short run.
        </p> It depends on how much risk you want to take. If you want no risk, try a CD. You can&#039;t touch the money for usually a period of 6 months, and at $10,000 you should be able to find a very high interest rate (through your bank). At the end of the 6 months, just allow it to extend another 6 months, and earn even more!
        </p> Ten thousand dollars is reasonable for investment. You should invest in emerging markets like Pakistan, India, and China.  <br>
 <br>
Invest equally in these three markets and you will have highest returns. I can help you open up an account with a broker in these three locations. If you require any help, please let me know.  <br>
