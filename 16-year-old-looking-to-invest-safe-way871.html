<h1>16 year old looking to invest safe way?</h1>
<div class="answer">Hi, 

I have a checking account, and a savings account and I want to save up for a $500 CD account for short term because of the CRAPPY rates. Then I want to save up $1000 from my checking account and use that money to open a Money Market account with minimum of $1000. $500 CD will have no monthly payments and the $1000 Money Market too will have no monthly payment.


Is this a good Idea??????????

My parents will NEVER let me invest or place my money on-line and they said im stuck with my local bank. TCF BANk.

I want to play around with my money...I worked hard for my money and it deserves something better you know what I mean...

BTW I don&amp;#39;t need the money until college when Im 18, I want to let you all know IM A BIG SAVER, I NEVER SPEND MY MONEY.

Plus, I get paid around $200-300 once every 2 weeks and will go directly to my bank..<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> You sound very saavy about money for such a young age. Unfortunately until you&#039;re 18 you can&#039;t do anything on your own, so you&#039;re going to have to find a way to talk to your parents. Let them know a cd in a bank is just like a savings account-there is no risk involved unless you&#039;re scared of the bank going under...but then of course with that low of an amout, you&#039;ll be FDIC insured (up to 100 k). Ask them if they would go with you to the bank to talk to a personal banker and have them explain it.
