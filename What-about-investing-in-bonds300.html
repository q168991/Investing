</script><p> Investing for optimal portfolio growth involves proportioning your investment between risk and risk free and bonds offer relatively risk free returns or at least risks that can be estimated from the risk premiums.   A Roth IRA is simply a tax sheltered account, you can invest in bonds, stocks, funds, whatever security you choose with the money you have in the account. <br>
 <br>
Ben Graham, in his book &quot;The Intelligent Advisor&quot; advocates evenly dividing your portfolio between bonds and stocks and periodically rebalancing them back to the 50/50 state particularly after a major market movement like a market crash thereby buying low, selling high.   This is identical to Claude Shannon&#039;s famous tangent during an engineering lecture where he derived &quot;Shannon&#039;s Demon&quot; as a method to harvest volatility from the stock market, it&#039;s called &quot;Shannon&#039;s Demon&quot; in reference to &quot;Maxwell&#039;s Demon&quot; which is a mathematically identical construct dealing with thermodynamic entropy while Shannon dealt with information entropy. <br>
 <br>
In 1738, Daniel Bernoulli wrote a paper titles &quot;Exposition of a new theory on the Measurement of Risk&quot; which was translated into English in a 1954 issue of Econometrica.   His paper provided guidelines to estimate the optimal proportioning of investments given your available resources by the use of the log utility of wealth.   Basically, he said that in matters of investing, the best choice is that with the highest geometric mean of outcomes.   If you assume that that a stock investment has a 2% per year chance of total loss (based on a report that the average life expectancy of a Fortune 500 company is 40 years) and that there is a 8% per year chance of a 60% loss (based on the assumption that there is a reasonable chance of a market downturn at least once every decade) and a 12% return otherwise (economists use 12% as a proxy for stock market investments) and you consider proportioning your portfolio between the stock investment and cash with X being the percentage of the portfolio to invest, you would adjust X to maximize the equation: <br>
 <br>
e^( 0.90 * ln( 1 - X + 1.12 * X ) + 0.08 * ln( 1 - X + 0.4 * X ) + 0.02 * ln( 1 - X ) ) <br>
 <br>
which would be at a maximum of 1.01025 when X is  0.45 so you would invest 45% of your portfolio in the stock and the rest kept as cash for optimal growth.   However, if you assume that the risk free portion is kept at 3.5% return (current 10 yr US Treasury bond rate) perhaps by having a margin account, holding the long term bond in margin as equity and using the margin to portfolio balance then the equation to maximize would be: <br>
 <br>
e^( 0.90 * ln( ( 1 - X ) * 1.035 + 1.12 * X ) + 0.08 * ln( ( 1 - X ) * 1.035 + 0.4 * X ) + 0.02 * ln( ( 1 - X ) * 1.035 ) ) <br>
 <br>
which would be a a maximum of 1.03521 when X is 0.08 so the maximum portfolio growth would be achieved when you invest 8% in the stock and the rest in the 10 year US Treasury bond.   Of course this neglects the probability that interest rates will rise and hence  better opportunities will arise thereby depreciating the market value of the bond but this illustrates that the risk free guarantee of a return is very much desirable and should prompt a heavier weighting towards bonds than one would expect.

</script><p> The short answer is, &quot;probably.&quot; However, nobody here can tell you how much you should invest in bonds, because we&#039;re not going to know anything about you, your goals, and your needs. For instance, the older you are and the sooner it will be that you hope to use money out of your investment accounts, the more &quot;bonds&quot; you probably should have. If you&#039;re very young and have a long time to let your portfolio grow, then you may not want to have much in the way of bonds at all. <br>
 <br>
There is also the issue of how well you can tolerate volatility. If the value of your portfolio goes down a lot, does that make you nervous? If so, then having a mix of stocks and bonds can reduce that roller coaster effect. Of course, it can also make the high hills less.... high.... <br>
 <br>
Investigate an idea called &quot;asset allocation,&quot; and try to find out what &quot;mix&quot; of stocks and bonds will be best for you.
        </p> Junk bond finances are the riskiest. Bonds are intended for predictable revenue, no longer danger. Bond finances include diversification, which means that extra protection from someone bond defaulting on fee. Bond finances don&#039;t seem to be that dicy. They do nevertheless pay a dividend like a inventory fund does. It does not pay a whole quantity versus an character bond. Most retirement plans encompass bond finances.
        </p> A Roth is an excellent choice, but you don&#039;t give any information on yourself like your age, how soon til retirement, how much risk is acceptable, etc. The more time you have the more risk you can safely take on. Many auto-pilot type funds (target retirement) usually have about 10% bond funds. Those with <br>
retirements from around 2025 or sooner start to have higher bond ratios. You might want to look at their target retirement funds on <br>

and compare the target funds.
