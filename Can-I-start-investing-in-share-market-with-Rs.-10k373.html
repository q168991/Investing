</script><p> That is acceptable but the most important thing is not to invest until you&#039;re thoroughly educated and practiced. <br>
 <br>
An introductory book like _Stock Markets for Dummies_ is a good place to start.  This will give you a basic explanation of most things there are to know about the mechanics of stock investing including useful websites to surf. <br>
 <br>
Investors Business Daily (IBD) is a solid daily resource (and its complement, ***investors*** ). It&#039;s a better newspaper than the Wall Street Journal and it is built around a particular approach to trading. You could read _How to Make Money in Stocks_ by William O&#039;Neil too--he&#039;s the founder of IBD.  <br>
 <br>
Search your local library for other books on stock investing. Try to absorb as much knowledge and understanding as you can.   <br>
 <br>
After you have extensively researched and gained a solid foundation/education then look to open a brokerage account and paper trade--this is trading with play money before you put real capital at risk.  You should do extensively before you eventually place your first trade live.  Your early live trades should be with a very small position size.  Only increase position size when you have done well to limit losses when the market has turned against you.

</script><p> This amount is absolutely fine as u can buy any stock in the market with this amount.  Minimum amount depends on which stock u r going to buy and its minimum traded volume.  For e.g., if the price of the stock is Rs 9.8 and the minimum traded volume is 10, then Rs. 125 is enough to invest in that stock (this includes a provision for brokerage, taxes, etc.) <br>
 <br>
 <br>
But, the best way to invest using this money is through an equity mutual fund, because u will get more diversification, better safety and lesser worries this way <br>
 <br>

        </p> Yes, you can start trading with this low 10k amount, but always study before stock investment.
        </p> Mutual funds take less risk compare to shares. But for a 6 month investments, mutual funds might not gain a lot as this is better for long term investments.
        </p> There is no such thing as minimum or maximum amount to start with. <br>
 <br>
10K is a good amount to start with. Go ahead. Do read more, study more. Exercise caution. And be reasonable in expectations. Wish you success and money.
