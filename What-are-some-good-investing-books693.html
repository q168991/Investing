<h1>What are some good investing books?</h1>
<div class="answer">I don&amp;#39;t want to invest in stocks...yet.  I am looking for some good books on the basics of investing. (terminology, what to look for in a mutual fund, etc.)<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Good call educating yourself on this stuff - you&#039;ll find that it&#039;s not too complicated, and it is VERY importand to know.  In this case, knowledge is one of the best investments you can make. <br>
 <br>
&quot;Mutual Funds for Dummies&quot; goes into depth on how to analyze a fund&#039;s performance.  Other good ones include &quot;Bogle on Mutual Funds,&quot; &quot;Morningstar Guide to Mutual Funds,&quot; and &quot;Common Sense on Mutual Funds.&quot; <br>
 <br>
It is important to know what you&#039;re investing in, but I always used to caution my clients not to get too hung up on picking the exact right fund.  Study after study has shown that WHICH fund you pick has much less bearing on your investing success than your investing habits (making regular contributions, periodic re-balancing, not selling in down markets, etc.).  Just be sure that you pick a good fund company - one that has a good selection of highly-rated funds, low fees, and excellent customer service.  My favorites are Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, and Fidelity.  If you&#039;re with a good fund company, then it is super easy to change or add funds down the road if you decide to go another direction. <br>
 <br>
I hope that helps - good luck!

</script><p> I agree.  The dummies series is probably the best.  However the book that you choose should be specific to the type of investing you are looking at. <br>
 <br>
There are ones for mutual funds, beginner stock investing, swing trading, day trading, charts ect.
        </p> Gotta chime in with the investors for dummies as well. <br>
 <br>
For what it&#039;s worth there&#039;s a website called investopedia that has a ton of information, but it can be a little weird getting around at first.  Also you can do paper trading and start looking at charts on yahoo&#039;s finance section.  Make sure you take a lot of notes when you start paper trading.  Say &quot;I invested in Mututal fund X, on this day, because these indicators showed me that _______&quot;  and continue keeping track of what happens as you hold the investment.
        </p> Literature on investments is massive--the two journals and books. determination might count on the point of history you already own. although, while you&#039;re build up one, then right here books could be powerful: a million. John M. Dalton (Ed): How the inventory marketplace Works 2. David M. Weiss: After the commerce is Made--processing securities transactions. somewhat up in coverage and therapy: Fischer &amp; Jordan: protection prognosis and Portfolio administration And progressed therapy and a good text fabric: Sharpe, Alexander &amp; Bailey: Investments examine them on and you will then initiate doing what i&#039;m now doing for you.
        </p> That’s great that you’re ready to learn about investing! <br>
 <br>
Learning about the stock market takes a bit of time, but it’s well worth it, and books are a great way to start. I also recommend Stock Investing for Dummies (no offense). It’s good book for understanding the basics. I would also recommend How to Make Money in Stocks by William J. O’Neil. It’s also a good one because it tells you what kind of fundamentals to look for in a stock, a bit about how to look for patterns in stock charts and how to protect your capital. It’s the first book I read when I started my stock trading and a very good start for stock investing or trading. Any questions about terms or anything go to Investopedia. <br>
 <br>
While you are learning, you can “paper trade” as you begin to learn strategies. That’s basically where you keep a fake portfolio of your trades. Yahoo&#039;s Finance page offers this service as well as some pretty good, free interactive charts.  <br>
 <br>
I also recommend going ahead and opening an investing account to gain access to stock market information, watch lists (fake portfolios) and tools you can use as you begin the stock investing process. You can also familiarize yourself with the broker’s trading platform so when you begin to trade you’ll have familiarity with how a trade is placed and have access to any resources related to the beginner investor. <br>
 <br>
Regarding mutual funds, you could try Morningstar . com which rates funds. Perhaps they have some educational content or refer to print materials for analyzing the funds. <br>
 <br>
That is so great you are interested in investing because when you learn how to invest you do it for yourself, your family and you act as an example to those who know you. Learning how to trade or invest will serve you your whole life! Best of luck in your investing.
