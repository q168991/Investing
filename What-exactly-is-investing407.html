</script><p> Investing involves putting money into something in hopes of getting returns or interest in the future.  One very common way of investing is through stocks.  When you purchase a stock, you are basically buying ownership, or a part of the company.  If you believe in a certain company, you will want to buy it&#039;s stock because the company&#039;s success would translate to profits for you as well. <br>
 <br>
In order to buy and sell stock, you must have a brokerage account.  Everyone can invest, but you must be 18 to open your own account.  If you are under 18, you can open a custodial account, which are accounts for minors managed by adults.  There are many different brokers out there.  I personally use Firstrade ( http://***firstrade*** ).

</script><p> Investment or investing[1] is a term with several closely-related meanings in business management, finance and economics, related to saving or deferring consumption. An asset is usually purchased, or equivalently a deposit is made in a bank, in hopes of getting a future return or interest from it
