<h1>Great books about investing and the stock market?</h1>
<div class="answer">Which books would you recommend for a beginning investor interested in the stock market? I&amp;#39;ve already read The Motley Fool&amp;#39;s Investment Guide For Teens, One Up on Wall Street, and I recently bought Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits. I&amp;#39;ve also considered getting The Intelligent Investor. Any other suggestions would be great.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

     style="display:block"
     data-ad-client="ca-pub-2926569078731101"

     data-ad-format="auto"></ins>
<script>
(adsbygoogle = window.adsbygoogle || []).push({});
</script><p> Keep your distance from any book that promises to teach you how to make millions. No honest book can. Indeed, I&#039;d stay away from any book that talks about beating Wall Street or doing anything else remarkable. The only exception would be Peter Lynch&#039;s books (which you&#039;ve already mentioned). <br>
 <br>
The classic introduction to value investing is The Intelligent Investor by Benjamin Graham. I&#039;d recommend this and Lynch&#039;s books and any college textbooks. Textbooks may be dry, but they won&#039;t lie to you or give you unrealistic expectations. If you&#039;re serious about investing, it&#039;s worth dealing with a bit of dryness. <br>
 <br>
I might add that these books won&#039;t really define the basic operations of the stock market. So if you&#039;re a total beginner, I&#039;d start with reading all the articles in Investopedia***. <br>
 <br>
Hope this helps. :D

        </p> First you&#039;ve got to get your head straight before you invest a nickle in the market. <br>
 <br>
Most investors do it just the opposite. <br>
 <br>
Lose all their money, then figure I might want to get my head straight. <br>
 <br>
Mark Douglas &quot;The Disciplined Trader&quot; is the absolute best book I have ever read about Psychology. <br>
 <br>
Next, you need to learn stock picking skills. <br>
 <br>
I would suggest &quot;Invest Like a Shark&quot; <br>
 <br>
One of the best books out there on how the stock market REALLY works. <br>
 <br>
Good luck and good trading!
        </p> Good plan. Start with _Dummies Guide to Stock Market Investing_ or _Idiots Guide to Stock Market Investing_--it doesn&#039;t really matter which. What matters is that you learn about all the basics.
        </p> Penny stocks are loosely categorized companies with share prices of below $5 and with market caps of under $200 million. They are sometimes referred to as &quot;the slot machines of the equity market&quot; because of the money involved. There may be a good place for penny stocks in the portfolio of an experienced, advanced investor, however, if you follow this guide you will learn the most efficient strategies https://tr.im/fb19f
        </p> I think it&#039;s absolutely great that you&#039;re reading up on investing! <br>
 <br>
I am a big advocate of value investing (finding great companies to invest in, buying them at the right prices, and only selling once they become overvalued...).   <br>
 <br>
The three best books that I&#039;ve read on the subject (and would recommmend) is: <br>
 <br>
- &quot;One Up On Wall Street&quot; by Peter Lynch <br>
- &quot;The Warren Buffett Way&quot; by Robert Hagstrom <br>
- &quot;The Intelligent Investor&quot; by Benjamin Graham <br>
 <br>
&quot;One Up On Wall Street&quot; gives you a nuts and bolts look at the kinds of companies that are worth investing in, and it&#039;s a great read.  One of the first books I read when I started investing... <br>
 <br>
&quot;The Warren Buffett Way&quot; really gives you a good understanding of how Warren Buffett got to be where he is today (one of the richest people in the world...) through his investing.  It gives a good overview of his investment philosophy and has really good examples... <br>
 <br>
&quot;The Intelligent Investor&quot; is a classic book (and it recommended by Warren Buffett himself) and through its pages introduces you to Mr. Market - Benjamin Graham&#039;s analogy for how the market is really emotional and sometimes irrational, giving the intelligent investor opportunities to take advantage of this emotion and really make superior returns... <br>
 <br>
Hope this helps, and good luck!

 <br>
Warren Buffett has stated that this book is the best EVER written about investing <br>
 <br>
(Graham was Buffett&#039;s Teacher)
        </p> Mutual Funds for Dummies by Eric Tyson. Not really for &quot;dummies.&quot;  Very informative. <br>
 <br>
The Warren Buffett Way by Roger Hagstrom.
        </p> Buffettology by Mary Buffett
        </p> Many of the suggestions you&#039;re getting are good. <br>
