</script><p> Mutual Funds are a thing of the past. The costs to enter, to exit, and to maintain take so much of the profits. Over $1T have left mutual funds and are not invested in ETF&#039;s. Easier to switch ETF&#039;s and the costs are so much less. Never buy Mutual funds thru a full service broker.

        </p> Hi , <br>
Which funds to invest in depends on the time frame fro which you  are willing to leave them invested and your risk taking willingness . If you are willing to look at a 5 year plus kind of view look at  the following funds  <br>
1. HDFC Equity fund <br>
2. Templeton Bluechip  <br>
3. Birla Sunlife Midcap  <br>
If your investment horizon is for less than five years consider a mix of debt and equity scheme.  <br>
In debt the following funds would be ideal <br>
1. Birla Dynamic Bond fund <br>
2. HDFC HIF <br>
When it comes to MFs .. old is Gold ! <br>
Appoint an independant  Financial Planner to give you  the best  advise to manage your money . It works !
        </p> I won&#039;t tell you which ones to buy but here are some facts. Mutual funds have a variety of strategies for different objectives based on risk and reward. I have no idea how funds are run in India.
        </p> Try existing funds with proven track records. New funds has higher costs than existing ones which hurt your returns. Also go for open end funds and if possible either diversified or balanced funds. <br>
 <br>

        </p> Buy emerging managers instead of older funds. <br>

        </p> Always choose funds with a historical record..... anything else is purely gambling.
