<h1>How do I get started investing in stocks?</h1>
<div class="answer">I dont have a lOT of money but I have a little and I would like to invest in a few stocks and watch to see if in the long run I can make a little profit but I dont really know alot about stocks. I have an ING savings acct and someon told me I should get a shareholder acct? Is this a good idea or does anyone know an easy inexpensive way to get started?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> If you don&#039;t know too much about stocks and dont know where to start, you might want to consider investing in a mutual fund. A mutual fund is a fund that invests in many stocks and is professionally managed. These funds will most likely give you a much better return than an ING account over the long run. Two great mutual fund companies are: <br>
 <br>
Vanguard  <br>
https://personal.vanguard***/us/home?fr... <br>
 <br>
and American Funds.  <br>
https://***americanfunds*** <br>
 <br>
Their websites will have plenty of information on the types of funds they offer and the different types of accounts (IRA, College Account, Personal Savings). Their sites will explain the differences. The sites will also tell you what the funds returns have been historically, what they are invested in and how volatile they are.  <br>
 <br>
Yahoo finance has great information on mutual funds as well.  <br>
http://finance.yahoo***/funds <br>
 <br>
This can hep you screen funds as well as get any information you need for any fund out there.  <br>
 <br>
If you want to invest in individual stocks, I think it&#039;s a good idea as long as you know what your getting into. You should know the risks involved. I takes a bit more on you part when getting started. You have to know what stocks you want to invest in and why.  <br>
 <br>
I also recommend testing the waters before you jump in. You can open an account at ***investopedia*** for free. There you can create a stock portfolio that will follow the actual stock market. You can see how you would have done had you invested real money. It also helps you see if you have the stomach for stocks. They have some great articles on getting started. It will go through the basics and has plenty of advanced topics for when you get there. Little by little you will get the hang of it and begin to know and understand stocks.  <br>

Best of luck to you.

 <br>
Pay any credit card off..Here&#039;s why. Most people pay around 15-24% interest rate.  If your investment does 10% annually then your are still loosing money (paying higher rate, than you are earning). <br>
 <br>
If you dont have dept, then by all means invest. Specially is you are young, you have time on your side (compounding is great). <br>
 <br>
Since your dont know much about a stock you may want to buy a mutual fund.  Some companies are no load (means no commission) and you can set up a systematic investment.  That is invest $100 per month (or more).  This way you buy more shares when the mutual fund is cheap and less when expensive. <br>
 <br>
As you get more comforatble with investments then start looking at stocks.   If you want to get started with stock keep in mind the following... <br>
 <br>
what do people really need (these stocks will probably do well alll the time) <br>
 <br>
What do people really want (these stocks will probably do well in Christmas or when economy recovers)
        </p> Before you invest in any security, the first investment you should make is in yourself, and the best investment you can make is by educating yourself.  <br>
 <br>
Start your education by learning why you should invest and the importance of being able to make your own decisions or how the pro’s make theirs. <br>
 <br>
Here is some reading material that can get you started in the right direction,  <br>
The first book you should read is Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki <br>
Then try some of these <br>
What Works on Wall Street by James O&#039;Shaunessey <br>
Beating the Street by Peter Lynch <br>
One Up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch <br>
The Warren Buffett Way by Robert Hagstrom <br>
Trading For a Living by Alexander Elder <br>
Mastering the Trade” by John Caster <br>
How to Make Money in Stocks” by William O’Neil <br>
24 Essential Lessons for Investment Success by William O’Neil <br>
The Disciplined Trader by Mark Douglas <br>
 <br>
Get into the habit of making daily visits to some websites like MSN Money and Yahoo Finance.  (http://moneycentral.msn***/home.asp http://finance.yahoo***/ ) <br>
 <br>
While at MSN following the strategy lab analysts to get a feel for what the pros are doing and why.  This site has some basic information for beginners. If any site offers free information, take it. <br>
 <br>
Other website that can provide instructions and help with procedures and terminology are  <br>
Investopedia - http://***investopedia***/  Stock Charts - http://stockcharts***/ <br>
http://***investorshub***/  http://***1source4stocks***/ <br>
  <br>
Visit some of the more professional websites like Zacks - http://***zacks***/  <br>
Smart Money - http://***smartmoney***/  Schaeffer’s – http://***schaeffersresearch***/ <br>
Some of these web sites will have advertisers who are worth looking into also.  And remember, if they offer free information, get it. <br>
 <br>
Attend all the free seminars you can, just be careful and don’t get pressured into anything you really don’t want or need. Most schools offer courses in finance and economics, but very few will have courses on the mechanics of the investment markets, if they do try taking the course. You may want to consider on-line courses, the New York Institute of Finance use to have such courses.  Try to get some fee information from the stocks exchanges they all have (had) free booklets, SIAC and some of the regulators (FINRA SEC MSRB CBOE) may provide some free literature. <br>
 <br>
You at least have made the right decision to start investing, this is the first big step and it won’t be your last. Keep taking those steps forward and along the way never take the advice from people that are not in the market or try to tell you not to invest.  <br>
 <br>
Good luck on your journey
        </p> Stock market always well come a beginner i like your spirit to enter in stock market prepare yourself before start investing check some basics. as per my experience Never invest more what you have. No over trading Never follow any tips research your self or follow any one person.
        </p> You start by educating yourself and WATCHING stocks before you invest.  There are lots of good books available such as &quot;Stock Investing For Dummies.&quot;
        </p> Try ETFs instead of indivisual stocks. <br>
 <br>
ETF(Exchange-Traded Funds) are index funds that trade just like stocks on stock exchanges. <br>
You can buy just like you buy stocks and can sell anytime you like. You can buy from just one share. <br>
 <br>
Here are some for starters: <br>
SPY  (tracks S&amp;P500 Index) <br>
DIA (tracks DowJonesIndustrial Index) <br>
QQQQ (Tracks Nasdaq100 Index) <br>
GLD (Tracks the price of Gold) <br>
OIL(Tracks the price of Crude Oil) <br>
 <br>
You can find more information here: <br>
http://finance.yahoo***/etf <br>
 <br>
To invest in indivisual stocks, some knowledge on corporate finance are necessary.
        </p> you should go for it <br>
first u invest small amt of in stocks after wards if u earn or lose dont be worry be happy <br>
my oinion is it get strated
        </p> stay clear of stocks without reading in depth what you are going to be heading for or else you may end up loosing what little you have got <br>
 <br>
if you want i would suggest you read a few books how to invest first then decide if you are willing to risk it
        </p> ive heard you need to pay a stock broker and its not worth it if your not investing alot of cash.
        </p> i wouldn&#039;t invest in stocks if you don&#039;t have much money
