</script><p> The simple answer is that it doesn&#039;t take years for ALL stocks to significantly increase.  Also, you can make money in the stock market by a stock price falling... (Lookup Shorting stocks) <br>
 <br>
Sounds like you need a book like investing for dummies.  Be careful investing in stocks.  If it were easy to be a millionaire doing it, everyone would do it...

</script><p> It&#039;s basically a game you have to learn to play.  It may take years to significantly increase, but a single stock could double in a day and turn a thousand into a couple grand.  There&#039;s also short selling where you sell a stock when it&#039;s high and buy it back when it falls in a short period of time, so you made a profit.  There&#039;s a bunch of other tricks too, I don&#039;t play the market myself so I don&#039;t know much about them. <br>
 <br>
Some people think stuff like this shouldn&#039;t be legal, but if it wasn&#039;t for this sort of investing, big companies wouldn&#039;t have a way of investing money on innovative ideas and start up companies, like Apple a couple decades ago, would not be as big today. <br>
 <br>
Also the people who play the stock market are taking really big risks.  A lot of investors lost everything during the recession, but those are the kind of risks you have to be willing to take to win big. <br>
 <br>
I don&#039;t think some regulation on investing would be a bad thing, but it&#039;s probably not going to happen.  Even some of the so called socialist regulations by the Democrats in congress have actually been really corporatist.  Whether it&#039;s the Republicans or Democrats, lobbyist are always going to have more say in the government than the average joe, so we might as well try competing in the corporate world we live in, and maybe we can make some change once we have the power to make it, if we haven&#039;t gotten greedy with power.
        </p> If a stock doesn&#039;t do anything for 4 years &amp; then goes up 50% in the fifth year.... the average increase for you would be 10% a year.  That&#039;s significantly better than any bank.  The only thing is.... you never know when it&#039;ll increase (significantly) or decrease....... but the averages are usually better than most other investments &amp; savings. <br>
 <br>
This type of compounding, with many stock positions can add wealth to your portfolio if your investments are consistent and done over many years.  Stocks are therefore a great way to secure your retirement.
        </p> Some invest in things that they expect with make significant short term changes.  That&#039;s very risky, though. <br>
 <br>
In general, if you wait long enough and have a well diversified portfolio, you will make money.  The idea isn&#039;t to double you money overnight, but historically, it&#039;s possible to double every 10 years or so. <br>
 <br>
Consider this: you have $10,000.  You invest it as a 25 year old.  It doubles every 10 years.  At 35, you have $20,000.  At 45, you have $20,000.  At 55, you have $40,000.  And, when you&#039;re thinking of retiring at 65, you have $80,000.  And that assumes that you didn&#039;t put more money in along the way. <br>
 <br>
If you need to make quick money, the stock market is a risky place to do it.
        </p> The old adage, &quot;it takes money to make money.&quot; If you invest $1, and the stock goes up 20% in a year, you now have an extra $0.20. If you had invested $1 million, you have added $200,000. Also, companies pay dividends on stocks. Owning 10 shares might get you a few dollars a year, where owning thousands of shares gets more dividends paid.
        </p> Investing is a lot like playing a video game. Does a game like, say HALO, require you to have an above average IQ to be able to win online matches? No, but it does require dedication, attention, and enthusiasm to become better than most other players out there. This is the same with the market for stocks or other investments.  <br>

        </p> If you have 100,000 shares of a particular stock ( penny stock, for example) and it rises just 5 cents, then you&#039;ve increased your wealth to the tune of $5,000. This is the allure of these often ridiculously high-risk plays that have an investor on the edge of his/her seat. <br>
