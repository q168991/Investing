</script><p> I read a lot about AMANA funds and decided to invest in both their Income and Growth funds. You make an minimum initial investment of $250 and then you can have a set amount automatically deducted from your account every month. The average return on these funds is about 22%/yr. That means if you had put in $2000 last year, it would be $2440 this year. You click http://***amanafunds***/amanx.html and then go to &quot;PROSPECTUS&quot; and near the end, there is a form to complete The only thing with mutual funds is it&#039;s not 100% guaranteed that you&#039;ll make the same return on your money every year. You could make 10% one year or even -10 the other. But historically, mutual funds do very well because they spread their stocks around different companies. <br>
 <br>
ING also has a lot of good funds you can invest in and they give you helpful bar graphs of Risk vs. Reward for each one. Basically the more risk you take the higher potential reward..but also there is a higher potential loss. For max. reward, you have to take max. risk. http://home.ingdirect***/products/produ... <br>
 <br>
Let us know what you decide to do with your money--I&#039;m curious to know :)

 <br>
From what I have seen so far there are two scam offers two mentions of Forex (which is glorfied GAMBLING)  and other assorted goodies.  <br>
 <br>
I&#039;ll start with Amana fund AMANX has an expense ratio of 1.37% and OVERWEIGHT in the material sector. NOT RECOMMENDED in this market. Know what you are getting into before making any investments. <br>
 <br>
The one advice I do like is paying your debt down first. That will help you in the long run but you don&#039;t need to pay it all down unless you have to.  <br>
 <br>
As for the market itself I would recommend Scottrade over SOGO anyday.  <br>
 <br>
My suggestion is take say $500 of it and pay your biggest bill down. Another $500 should go to an online investment bank (I use ING but there are others out there) and then you could either spend the rest on yourself or invest in either the market or mutual fund of your choice. But Forex is for serious investors with money to burn freely. You don&#039;t have that luxry.  <br>
 <br>
In other words be SMART with it.
        </p> Open an account with an on-line brokerage firm (like ScottTrade).  Do some research and invest in something that promises a good return with acceptable risk.  Only you can know how much risk you are willing to assume.  On one side of the spectrum are bonds and money market funds, on the other are small cap stocks or penny stocks.
        </p> I would say invest it in the stock market. <br>
You can open an account with sogoinvest - the stock brokers paradise. It takes only 5 mins to open account. $3 per trade is cheap investing in stocks. You can go to their home page and they are offering Live Help if you want to talk to them and still confused !
        </p> Mutual Funds: You should know the meaning of mutual funds, before you choose to invest in mutual funds. These funds are a type of security that can be traded on the stock market, allowing shareholders to buy and sell shares in the funds. The revenue generated by purchase of shares is used by mutual fund manager to buy more shares of specific stocks, bonds, and other market securities and money market instruments. <br>
