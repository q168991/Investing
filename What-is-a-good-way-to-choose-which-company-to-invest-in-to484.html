</script><p> I invest based on the company&#039;s business model.  I would choose (for example) google over walmart, because google is a constant presence with strong community support (their customers, vendors and employees are all very happy with them and their business practices show continued gain)

        </p> Penny stocks are loosely categorized companies with share prices of below $5 and with market caps of under $200 million. They are sometimes referred to as &quot;the slot machines of the equity market&quot; because of the money involved. There may be a good place for penny stocks in the portfolio of an experienced, advanced investor, however, if you follow this guide you will learn the most efficient strategies https://tr.im/e3f14
        </p> There is no foolproof way, but a really good way is simply to invest in companies you know; where you know the companies sales and earnings are going up and you know the company isn&#039;t doing anything wrong (to the best of your knowledge).  This is essetially a rehash of what one great stock picker said (Peter Lynch) - Invest in what you know. <br>
 <br>
Still you may have to hold the company for a long time and there are no guarantees, but its a great strategy.
        </p> a great way to invest is NOT to try to pick individual stocks...  most people lose out that way. <br>
 <br>
Buy low cost &#039;no load&#039; mutual funds or &#039;index funds&#039; and hold for the long term.  That is a sure fire winner way.
        </p> There is no fool proof way to invest but there are several that work pretty well.  One is buying breakouts.
        </p> I choose a company which products/service I use. <br>
Like Walmart! I spend a lot of money at Walmart so my mutual funds have a large % of Walmart stock. <br>
 <br>
Or coke or Johnson and Johnson ect.....
        </p> Hire me as your Portfolio Manager.
