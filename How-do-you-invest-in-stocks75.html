</script><p> &quot;Stock tips&quot; aren&#039;t really tips at all. <br>
 <br>
To do successful trades, you have to have your own set of trading rules.  <br>
 <br>
I&#039;m going to share with you some of my trading rules.  <br>
 <br>
I can tell you 70+ members of our trading groups can&#039;t be wrong. We follow our own sets of trading rules. Whether or not you&#039;ll use them is another matter. I&#039;ll also include some trading sayings. <br>
 <br>
A] &quot;On Wall Street there aren&#039;t any gifts.&quot;  <br>
No one gives anyone else anything - not even stock tips. <br>
 <br>
B] Bulls [Buyers] earn money. <br>
Bears [Sellers] earn money. <br>
Pigs get fat. <br>
Hogs [Greedy Traders] get slaughtered. they lose the money in their trading accounts. <br>
 <br>
C] Here&#039;s what no one in our trading gruops won&#039;t do: <br>
1] We WILL NOT trade &quot;cheap&quot; [inexpensive] stocks. We will not trade .BB [dot BB, which is the Bulletin Board],  <br>
.PK [dot PK, which is the Pink Sheet]  <br>
O-T-C [Over-the-Counter]. <br>
The above stocks are far too risky and volatile. <br>
 <br>
2] We WILL NOT trade any stock which trades less than $26.51 per share. We do not want to be part of any &quot;pity party&quot;. <br>
 <br>
3] We WILL NOT trade any stock which has less than 400,000 shares/volume per day. Volume less than this makes the stock too risky and volatile for the retail trader. Those traders with deeper pockets [having more money] can trade stocks with less volume. <br>
 <br>
4] We WILL NOT trade any IPOs [Initial Public Offerings]. These stocks do not have any history to follow. They are far too risky. <br>
 <br>
5] We WILL NOT trade any stock with less than 18 months of trading history. <br>
 <br>
6] We WILL NOT trade against the trend. <br>
 <br>
7a] We WILL NOT trade any stock betwen the price of $45.01 to $55.51 up OR down. Stocks in this range are known as &quot;the doldrums&quot; - they have a tendency to get stuck and not move.  <br>
7b] We WILL NOT trade any stock from $73.01 to $76.51 another &quot;doldrum range&quot;. <br>
7c] We WILL NOT trade any stock from $94.01 to $106.51 - yet another &quot;doldrum range&quot;.  <br>
 <br>
D1] When we do our research, we check the following: The Earnings Announcement Date. This happens 4 times each year, about every 3 months. Different stocks have different EADs. <br>
D2] We check for stock splits.  <br>
D3] We check the sector and the industry. We check for the trend in that stock&#039;s sector. <br>
D4] We ALWAYS check the news for each stock. <br>
 <br>
F] When ALL the criteria and rules are met: Plan your trade. THEN trade your plan.  <br>
When you know the proper strategies, know how to use them AND you follow your rules, you can earn money when the stock goes up.  <br>
You can earn money when the stock goes down,  <br>
You can earn money when the stock goes sideways. <br>
 <br>
USUALLY numbers in the stock market are expressed in percentages and in dollars and cents. <br>
 <br>
Here&#039;s an example: <br>
ABC is currently at $27.50 per share. <br>
You did your investigating and research. This stock passed ALL your rules. <br>
You have your entry at $27.78 or 1% to prove the stock&#039;s trend. <br>
Your target is $30.56 or 10% <br>
IF the trade should go against you and you lose money, you will get out of the trade at $25.56 or 8%. This is so you can trade another day. <br>
 <br>
As a foot note: We DO NOT put any more than 15% of our total trading account balance in any one trade. If our balance is $10,000 we do not put any more than $1,500 into any trade. Our entry is $27,78. We can buy 50 shares of ABC. For some reason or another, brokerrs and others like rounded off numbers of shares.  <br>

</script><p> I´ve been investing for more than 20 years and trading for almost 14, and I can tell you that if you want to make BIG and FAST profits, I recommend you trading rather than investing, trading can help you to go from rags to rich.  <br>
If you are investing, you must have already achieved some degree of financial success, long term stock investing and FOREX can help you become much richer than you are today. <br>
 <br>
My experiences as a Nasdaq Market Maker, Head trader of seveal brokerage firms, and currently as a professional trader and private hedge fund manager, I can sugest you that: <br>
 <br>
We trade because we want quick, short term profits on a consistent basis. We want to cash flow the market. Milk it like a cow.  <br>
Make consistent, small, short term gains rather than trying to hit a home run on every trade. Don&#039;t ever forget that. <br>
Don&#039;t marry a stock, marry the idea of making money trading stocks. That&#039;s the only way to do it.  <br>
 <br>
For me &quot;All stocks are equally worthless” <br>
 <br>
I don&#039;t hold on to any illusion that the stock market will continue to go up and provide a nice retirement for me. <br>
I could care less which way the market goes. It&#039;s irrelevant to me if the market goes higher, crashes or moves sideways for the next 50 years. I really could care less. Stocks are just four letters with two prices next to them that I use to make a living trading.  <br>
 <br>
Trade ONLY when you have a clear, easy and identifiable advantage, because without a CLEAR EDGE your odds of success are NO better than a flip of a coin… That´s why so many new traders (and investors) lose money. <br>
 <br>
Take a look at any daily chart of any index or stock and you&#039;ll probably see the most volatility and the biggest opportunity for profit during the first Hour of the stock market&#039;s opening.  <br>
 <br>
The popular thinking and conventional wisdom is that you should wait about an hour before you start trading.  <br>
 <br>
But if you do, you&#039;ll miss the big, fast moves that stocks make as all the amateurs let their emotions out through their online accounts, usually right after they read some news headline or hear Maria Bartiromo go off about a stock on CNBC.  <br>
 <br>
It&#039;s easy to see why trading the open is the market&#039;s prime time for profiting from other online traders.  <br>
The market&#039;s open is very volatile - that is the perfect environment for LARGE, FAST profits.  <br>
 <br>
Learn to trade as a professional Market Maker ,not as an emotionally driven amateur trader or investor with few thousand dollars in an account at Etrade. <br>
 <br>
There isn&#039;t any other time during the day or any stock you can invest in, that can make you 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 or more points in minutes OTHER than during the first hour the stock market is open. That&#039;s why I love trading the open so much.  <br>
 <br>
I trade only when I have an edge and that means &quot;only the fisrt hour the market is open&quot;.  <br>
 <br>
If you are a beginning trader, you can give yourself an unfair advantage in the market trading this way. <br>
 <br>
I can continue giving you a lot of advises about how to make money trading, but if you ask me: <br>
&quot;What is the best thing you can do for me or that I can do for myself?  <br>
Go to this hiden site and learn the BEST guarded system on making the largest and fastest day trading profits you´ve ever seen... <br>
 <br>
***onehourtrading*** <br>
 <br>
After you review this site you won´t need any other system, strategy, book, software or mentor to tell you what to do,  <br>
you will be able to find big profits opportunities evey day, and don´t rely on anybody. <br>
 <br>
Good luck and good trading, <br>

        </p> It sounds as if you are a new investor. <br>
 <br>
There are 2 great ways to get started investing and they are conservative and don&#039;t cost much to get started. <br>
 <br>
Your first option should be to fund fully a retirement account. If you do this, and you have extra cash, then one of the best things you can do is open a DRIP Plan. <br>
 <br>
These powerful investment plans are seldom talked about because brokers make very little money when they suggest them. Yet, they have proven to be one of the best, if not the best, long-term strategy on Wall Street.  <br>
 <br>
They are perfect for small investors, as well as big investors. They are safe and allow you to not care about whether the market is going up or down. They are a must for any serious investor. <br>
 <br>
I strongly recommend looking into it. They are great plans.
        </p> How does Trading Work? I can say you that take a look at this site ( http://forexsignal.kyma.info ) may be it can help you. It &#039;s one of the best course about trading. It seems like Trading is almost totally based on Macro-economics. It also strikes me that since there are not nearly as many currencies as there are stocks/bonds/derivatives etc etc, there must be a large number of market players in each currency bracket. So logically, currencies must be very liquid true? Also, what is the risk of Currency trading, high or low? When I read the business section every day I notice that the Canadian loonie moves hardly a tenth of a cent on a regular basis (in comparison to the US dollar). So it seems like theres very little room for growth in currencies unless you leverage. On that note, whats the maximum leverage permitted for forex trading. I know in stocks its x2, and in derivatives its x10. Anyway the only way to know how to start a profitable buisness is by following some methods like the one that I suggested.
        </p> I started working with penny stocks less then one year ago and I think it&#039;s great! There are a lot of opportunities to make big money, you just need to find them! <br>
 <br>
At the beginning for me was really useful the support of this method http://penny-stock.keysolve.net  <br>
 <br>
It&#039;s a simple course that will teach you how to move your first steps and how to grow fast in this buisness. <br>
I will tell you how was my first experience: <br>
I started with a lighting technology company that was overdue a breakout from 75 cents. <br>
Just two weeks after I alerted my subscribers… that breakout arrived! A 362% return later and the stock had risen to $3.47 cents… <br>
Turning my starting stake of $1,000 into $4,625, and it was just the beginning!
        </p> Penny stocks are loosely categorized companies with share prices of below $5 and with market caps of under $200 million. They are sometimes referred to as &quot;the slot machines of the equity market&quot; because of the money involved. There may be a good place for penny stocks in the portfolio of an experienced, advanced investor, however, if you follow this guide you will learn the most efficient strategies https://tr.im/4ed13

        </p> There was a study done with monkeys, kindergardners and stock brokers. kindergardners picked the stocks they knew: Disney, toys&#039;r&#039;us, etc. Stock brokers did it their way. Ststistics, etc. And the monkeys picked stocks by throwing darts at a wall.. long story short.... stock brokers came in last. monkeys second, and kindergardners came in first... Pick stocks you know of and buy products from.
