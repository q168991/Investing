<div class="answer">Please I want nothing to do with the stock market, that is a ridiculous spectator sport based only on others reactions and impulses.  I am looking for ideas from large amounts to small amounts<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Hi FIL, <br>
First consider that there&#039;s a difference between saving and investing.  Saving might be for a short or long time but always involves relatively safe ways of using money.  Savings accounts, CD&#039;s, money market accounts, and putting your cash under the mattress are all examples of saving.  The problem with saving is that while the risk to your money is low, the reward in the form of returns is also low.  In fact, right now you&#039;re actually earning next to nothing in interest on any of the methods I mentioned above.  Beyond that you pay an &quot;opportunity cost&quot; by saving.  That is, you lose the opportunity to make a better return on your money had you invested it.  Investing involves, at its best, a long-range strategy.  Over 20-30 years money that&#039;s invested in stocks and bonds has a high probability of higher returns then a CD or savings account.  A reasonable way of managing your money is to create a balanced portfolio of stocks, bonds, and short-term instruments like CD&#039;s that correspond to your risk tolerance and time horizon.  That means not putting all your eggs in one basket.  A good rule of thumb is to own your age +/- 10 in bonds, have 6 months worth of expenses saved in case of an emergency, and the rest in a broad no-load index mutual fund.   <br>
 <br>
Given the high volatility of the markets in recent quarters I can understand your reluctance to invest there.  Before you write off the stock market though, consider that over the long term there&#039;s been no better place to invest.  Most people get into trouble in the stock market by trying to time the market or by investing in individual stocks based on a &quot;tip&quot; from a brother-in-law or neighbor.  Take a look at Eric Tyson&#039;s excellent books on investing and mutual funds in the &quot;Dummies&quot; series.  Best wishes.

</script><p> That depends on many factors. There is no &quot;right&quot; answer for everyone. Your goals, resources, tolerance for risk, and timelines are all critical to answering this question.  <br>
 <br>
One idea is distressed real estate. If you have the excess cash available, and/or outstanding credit, and the ability and time frame to examine multiple properties, the ability to negotiate your best possible deal, and the willingness to &quot;walk&quot; if you don&#039;t get it, then you may do well if you can hold the property until values reemerge.   <br>
 <br>
If you have the interest and willingness to do the research on potential valuation, you can look at collectibles - some choose fine art. Some rare coins, some rare automobiles. <br>
 <br>
Beyond that, preciosu metals may be an option in an inflationary environment, or in leading a resurgence when the economy turns around.   <br>
 <br>
At present volatily levels, nothing should be interpreted as a &quot;sure thing&quot;.  This is why so many who HAVE cash are sitting on it, thinking their buys will get better.  You must, after the appropriate research, make the call, or pay someone of your choice to make it for you.
        </p> I also like George&#039;s answer for the most part, but I think that the general public is overconfident in the &quot;stocks outperform in the long term&quot; mantra because that is what the financial sector has been drilling in our heads. <br>
 <br>
&quot;Starting at any time from 1980 up to 2008, an investor in 20-year Treasuries, rolling them over every year, beats the S&amp;P 500 through January 2009. Even worse, going back 40 years to 1969, the 20-year bond investors still win, although by a marginal amount. And that&#039;s with a very bad bond market in the 1970s. &quot; <br>

 <br>
This does not mean to invest in bonds; interest rates can&#039;t go much lower so bond prices can&#039;t go much higher... <br>
 <br>
My personal investment outlook is close to cpdaman&#039;s, although this is an agressive strategy and not suitable for everyone.
        </p> Depends on when you need the money, how much you have to invest ($100 in large to some people while a million is to others), the percentage of your portfolio it represents, what it&#039;s for, how much risk you&#039;re willing to take, and your tax situation.  There are literally thousands of things you can do. Unless you know the answers to those questions you&#039;lll  be disappointed with your result.  Anyone that tries to answer your question without that info is doing you more harm than good.  Blindly telling someone else what to do with their money without any details is irresponsible. If you avoid the stock market because it is based on impulse you should never even think about commodities like oil and gold or real estate.   <br>
 <br>
GeorgeG makes a lot of sense in the answer above. <br>
 <br>
Good luck!
        </p> i would say quite honestly that now is a very difficult time to answer that question <br>
 <br>
I think in the next few months ...that Oil will dip down below 45$ and that when it does it will be one of the best investments (buying opportunity&#039;s you can make)....i would allocate about 35% there. <br>
 <br>
I read lots of financial news and am very skeptical of people&#039;s financial advice...but this seems solid to me now <br>
 <br>
Gold has already rose several hundred % since 2000 so it&#039;s not like you can really buy low now.  <br>
 <br>
I would also put a chunk into CD&#039;s about 65%  <br>
 <br>
and should inflation Actually tick up you could shift some of that CD into TIPS   treasury inflation protected security&#039;s.....but waiting for  significant inflation in this depressionary process will likely take longer than most think
        </p> No, as a student you should not be risking your small savings in the stock market. If you want to learn about the stock market and other investment options, read &quot;Investing for Dummies.&quot;
        </p> The safest investments are probably CD&#039;s and money market accounts through a bank. Next would be bonds, as long as they are highly rated.  Stay away from junk bonds if you don&#039;t want risk;  they are called Junk Bonds because it is more likely that the company will default on the bonds leaving you with junk. <br>
 <br>
The stock market can be hazardous, but that doesn&#039;t mean every stock is dangerous.  There are ETF&#039;s that diversify risk by holding parts of many different companies. <br>
 <br>
Check out http://monthly-dividend-stocks***/.  It&#039;s my friend&#039;s site that lists ETF&#039;s, Closed End Funds, and trusts that pay monthly dividends.  Due to copyright laws, he can&#039;t display those investments&#039; dividend yields  on his site, but it is a very thorough list.  You will have to do some work to find the yields on your own.  He also outlines his investment strategy, which I think diversifies the risk while providing a decent return.  And, it&#039;s an easy strategy to follow.
        </p> Buy rental property it will produce income for you and with prices being as low as they are right now the will appreciate.  Buy vacant land for long term appreciation; if you know where the next highway, McDonald&#039;s or shopping mall will be built it will appreciate even faster.   <br>
 <br>
Of course you could buy a new car, that is at the end of production.  Then just put it up on a rack and let it appreciate for about 20 years, without any miles on it, too.
        </p> the stock market is no spectator sport if you invest in it rather than speculate, but yeah, open a business if you want some money. Even though opening a business is plenty similar to owning shares in another business.
        </p> There are lots of options apart from the stock market, which I agree is more for speculation than investing. I have set myself a strict criteria for selecting a company to invest with, and posted the details on a blog. Check it out, and keep researching your options.

         Mutual Funds, Postal savings, Bank Fixed deposits, carefully run Chit funds, company fixed deposits, PF etc are some of other possibilities. <br>
 <br>
Buying gold, silver, exchange futures are also good investments.
        </p> If u want to earn money through investment u have a lot of options like trading in  commodities including gold n silver,reality,foreign exchange n saving in banks n post offices n finally doing business of ur choice.Reality gives very attractive return.
        </p> If you have money to invest, open your own business in the area that you like. Do you know what is your purpose on Earth? I also need money, I liked your question, but I guess it depends on where you are and what resources do you have. So get back to me with more specific questions then.
        </p> Your best trade is silver long term. It is used in all Electronics from cell phones to computers.As the developing demands more goods the price of SILVER will rise.Also as the buying power of the US dollar falls silver and gold will rise.Buy silver for the long term
        </p> Treasuries are quite safe as long as it is not US treasuries and other countries under ridiculous debt like spain etc...US has the most debt in the world according to the CIA website.  Treasuries are backed by governments so be sure to pick one with a stable government and good financial standing.

i have attended a lot of seminars, read counless books on forex trading and it all cost me thousands of dollars. the worst thing was i blew up my first account. after that i opened another account and the same thing happened again. i started to wonder why i couldn,t make any money in forex trading. at first i thought i knew everything about trading. finally i found that the main problem i have was i did not have the right mental in trading. as we know that psychology has great impact on our trading result. apart from psychology issue, there is another problem that we have to address. they are money management, market analysis, and entry/exit rules. to me money management is important in trading. i opened another account and start to trade profitably after i learnt from my past mistake. i don&#039;t trade emotionally anymore.  <br>
if you are serious about trading you need to address your weakness and try to fix it. no forex guru can make you Professional trader unless you want to learn from your mistake.
