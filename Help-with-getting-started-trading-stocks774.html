<h1>Help with getting started trading stocks?</h1>

I am not looking to do any day trading but more of weekly, monthly, yearly trades... where do i start once i have practiced enough through simulation and feel ready to enter the market? p.s. i only have a couple of thousand to start with.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

What Does Investing Mean? <br>
The act of committing money or capital to an endeavor (a business, project, real estate, etc.) with the expectation of obtaining an additional income or profit. Investing also can include the amount of time you put into the study of a prospective company, especially since time is money.  Investopedia explains Investing <br>
Investing is the key to building wealth, but investing in and of itself is not enough. You have to invest wisely!  <br>

</script><p> If you&#039;re a rookie in investing or stocks, go to <br>
 <br>
***finance.yahoo***. <br>
 <br>
Open up a portfolio without using real money. You can give yourself as much or as little money to try out the market. The stocks you want to focus on is consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and healthcare. These are DEFENSIVE stocks that will survive through good and bad times. Most of my positions are in these stocks. Some names include 3M, Procter &amp; Gamble, Kimberly Clark, Exxon Mobil, Walmart, Costco. Everybody&#039;s got to eat and wipe their butts regardless of the state of economy. Many of these companies survived through the Great Depression. <br>
 <br>
That&#039;s the benefits. You can sleep at night knowing your money is doing well. There are NO guarantees that you won&#039;t lose money. It&#039;s just that these stocks are the best. They pay good dividends too. <br>
 <br>
Then once you&#039;re comfortable and test the waters of the market, you can finally put some real money in. Go to Scottrade***. They&#039;re excellent for beginners. <br>
 <br>
If you&#039;re new to stocks, DON&#039;T DAY TRADE. You&#039;ll a rookie in a world of professionals. I tried day-trading with Citigroup and AIG when they were a little bit over $1. I had some luck at first, making about $30 a day but I was way over my head. My luck didn&#039;t last long and I had to rethink my strategy. <br>
 <br>
Day trading involves A LOT of commissions to the broker. With all the commissions deducted from each trade, you&#039;ll be lucky if you only lose half your money. <br>
 <br>
I would just day trade using Yahoo! Finance. Open a stimulation account, give yourself $100 worth of fake money and play it in the stimulation format. You&#039;ll see what I mean by losing money every easily. <br>
 <br>
Good luck.
        </p> Scottrade is good for beginners, open an account with them.  You control everything, you can then learn about what different terms mean by reading on the internet or watching videos.  It&#039;s $7 to buy and $7 to sell, so buying and selling costs you $14, which is not too bad.  After you get comfortable with what you are doing you can always move your account to somewhere else.  Everyone has their own strategy when trading, but everyone must also follow a set of rules, once you learn them you will be having a blast and making loads of cash. Good Luck
        </p> If you want to control your account yourself then dont give power of attorney to your broker. Then he will not be able to trade on your behalf. <br>
 <br>
This is safe as he cannot trade on your behalf so you can sit back assured against any fraud but in case you are unable to trade or away from your screen this can be painful. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Also simulation and real market are 2 different things. In later real money is at stake and situation is similar when you are solving problem in examination hall and in your room. <br>
