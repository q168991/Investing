<h1>Financial Advice Needed! Please Help!?</h1>
<div class="answer">We are 29 and 30 years old. 

We have currently $22,325 in savings. We have ZERO credit card debt, but do have student loans of $14,000 and $4,000 along with a car payment of $9,000. We currently do not own a home, as I only work part-time, but do rent. We are nervous, because we have a child coming in the next couple of weeks. 

So with that being said, I want to know what we can do to make money off our money. We currently have $2,325 in a MAX rate savings account that is 3.0% Interest. We have $16,000 in a 5 month CD at 4.69% interest and $4,000 in a 3 month CD at 3.27% interest. 

What should we be doing with our money? We don&amp;#39;t want to take risks in the stock market, but want to get more of a return on our money then we currently are. 

Please help, any suggestions are welcome!<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> See this is my experience -  <br>
 <br>
I have money in 401K, IRA, CD, Savings etc. 401K and IRA is for long long benefits. CD and Savings can be short term but low returns. I understand your nervousness about stock market, but higher the risk higher will be return.  <br>
 <br>
I was nervous when I started investing in the stock market - today, a company&#039;s stocks which I bought last March (2007) has given me  115% return on my investment. Now, will I get this kind of rate with my CD or Savings? never! <br>
 <br>
It would be better if you talk to some financial broker or a mutual fund analyst and help you figure out what you want to do with your money. Mutual funds are better than individual stocks, but still they are stocks.  <br>
 <br>
I am no expert in investing, but for me there are few stocks which are giving me an excellent rate of return i.e. 115%, 65%, 13%, 8% etc. But there are few other stocks who are in negative i.e. -56%, -35%, -15% etc.  <br>
 <br>
But I am willing to take that risk. I am single; don&#039;t own a home but own an expensive new BMW - which I promised myself that I will pay off with the profits I make on my investments. Even with this ghost of recession I am not scared. I haven&#039;t sold any of the stocks so far... <br>
 <br>
It would be better for you if you take advice from Fidelity, Charles Schwab, Prudential etc. and focus on long-term.  <br>
 <br>
Again, I am no expert. Do you research  or talk to an investment expert before investing. It always carries substantial risk.

</script><p> Although you say you do not want the risk of the stock market - I think you should have some money in stock.  The market is volitile right now, but has performed well over the long-term. <br>
 <br>
You need a cash reserve - I would keep about $10,000 in a money market checking account or savings account - check out rates for these at your bank or on line. <br>
 <br>
You might want to consider a mutli-sector bond fund for some of your investment dollars - since you appear conservative - probably about 50% of assets you would be willing to put some place other than CD&#039;s. <br>
 <br>
For the other 50% you might want to consider a conservative or moderately conservative asset allocation mutual fund.
        </p> Because you have a child coming and do not own a home, yet, you really want to invest where there is -0- risk of losing some of your hard-earned savings.   Both the stock market and mutual funds stand to lose if the current market declines. <br>
 <br>
The only real safe investment that can give you a greater interest rate than the banks is US Treasury bills (not bonds).  You can do this yourself by setting up an account with Treasury Direct (800-722-2678), web site: ***treasurydirect.gov
        </p> It sounds like you are doing a great job right now.  Unfortunately, your saving accounts are losing your money over time because of inflation and taxes.  You do need to risk some money to beat inflation.  The stock market is taking a beating.   <br>
I placed most of my investment money in Prosper.  The link is below.  I loan out my money to others legally.  Even with some defaults the worst that I have done is 13.7% and the best is 17.4%.  If you want to have a lower risk you can get around 8%.  Most of my money is going here and a small percentage is going into stocks.
        </p> you are on the right track. if you have zero tolerance for risk your return while safe is not going to make you wealthy overnight. you may find slightly higher rates in your basic savings account (example 4.25% at wamu) but that is marginal for the amount you have there.  <br>
 <br>
if your retirement fund is invested in a mix of stocks (domestic and international) and bonds you will be fine in the long haul. clearly the market is hurting so far this year but you have a lot of years ahead of you and over time the market is still the best place for returns.  <br>
 <br>
good luck!
        </p> Your options are probably limited to CDs, various money market accounts and the like, unless you want to have some risk.  If you put yourself in a position for some risk (i.e. mutual funds focusing on growth stocks) your rate of return could potentially be higher. <br>
 <br>
Basically, the more risk you can possibly handle, the more the associated reward could be.
        </p> It appears to me that you are doing everything correctly. You are funding your retirement accounts.  <br>
 <br>
I would suggest concentrating on getting rid of all debt as soon as you can. That is always a great investment.  <br>
 <br>
As far as higher returns, if you move it to something other than CD&#039;s or savings, your risk level will rise. <br>
 <br>
I do not recommend mutual funds, as I know there will be several people who tell you to put your money in mutual funds. About 75% of them under perform the market, and yes, they can lose their value.  <br>
 <br>
Stay where you are at and get rid of your debt. <br>
 <br>
Good Luck
        </p> yes she made bad choices in her life , but could you help her to get back on track ? maybe you could take over the financial situation and make sure the money goes to the bills . Maybe even she would qualify for some financial aid from the state somewhere . maybe food stamps or so . Even when she is working she may still quailfy for something .maybe you can go with her and get something done. Even those fathers of the childrens need to pay up !
