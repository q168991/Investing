<h1>Is it a good or a bad time to invest in mutual funds in India?</h1>
<div class="answer">I was reading suggestions of some financial planner in a newspaper where he had advised to stay away from mutual fund investments in SIP mode for the time being. I was surprised to read this. I thought when market is down, it is good to invest in mutual funds. The financial planner did not give any reason why he suggested that. Can anybody please explain why this is perhaps a bad time to invest in mutual fund in SIP mode? (Some people guess the current trend will probably continue at least for one more year or slightly more than that.)<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> SIP works best in any market conditions. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
While, investing in a mutual fund solves the issue of &#039;where&#039; to invest, SIP helps us to overcome the problem of &#039;when&#039;. SIP is a disciplined investing irrespective of the state of the market. It thus makes the market timing totally irrelevant. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Infact i feel looking at market valuation starting SIP (now) in this period will be good decision. <br>
 <br>
This is normal tendecy when stock markets don&#039;t perfom people stay away and when it start performing people enter at very high valuation, like same which we observe for gold sip, gold fund and investment in gold.

</script><p> Yes, these days Mutual fund is the best option for investment, Markets are down and in the future there are more chances to earn more profit.
        </p> If the european crisis r solved then the market will be positive . I feel market will have a negative impact and it will be worsed compared to 2008 crisis so wait a while before investing in MF
        </p> There is no foreign investment in India and rupee value going down.
