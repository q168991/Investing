</script><p> There is no limit as to when some one should start investing. The younger you start the better off you will be down the road, <br>
I started when I was 12 and never had any regrets. <br>
 <br>
In order to open and account in your own name you must be at least 18 years of age, BUT don&#039;t let this deter you, you can open an account with one of your parents (or guardian) acting as your custodian. <br>
 <br>
Unless you know something about the investing, you maybe best looking to into some mutual fund products <br>
Mutual Fund companies have an entire array of products many will fit your needs. <br>
 <br>
You can go to the MSN.Money website it has an entire section on mutual funds.  Read about the various funds and in doing so you will be getting investment ideas and at the same time educating yourself about investing. <br>
 <br>
You could also contact the funds companies for more information.  I have found that Vanguard &amp; Fidelity can meet your needs.  The service and information they provide is all free and you will find it helpful.  And remember, keeping you money in a bank or bank product is not investing. <br>
 <br>
In the meantime  get into the habit of making daily visits to some websites like MSN Money and Yahoo Finance.  While at MSN read the Commentaries by Jim Jubak, Jon Markman, Harry Domash, and Liz Pullman Weston.  Following the strategy lab analysts to get a feel for what the pro’s are doing and why.  This site has some basic information for beginners. If any site offers free information, take it.  <br>
Other website that can provide instructions and help with procedures and terminology are Investopedia***, Stock Charts***, and 1source4stocks*** <br>
 <br>
Attend all the free seminars you can, just be careful and don’t get pressured into anything you really don’t want or need. Most schools offer courses in finance and economics, but very few will have courses on the mechanics of the investment markets, if they do try taking the course. You may want to consider on-line courses, the New York Institute of Finance use to have such courses.  Try to get some fee information from the stocks exchanges they all have (had) free booklets, SIAC and some of the regulators (NASD SEC MSRB CBOE) may provide some free literature <br>
 <br>
You at least have made the right decision to start investing, this is the first big step and it won’t be your last. Keep taking those steps forward and along the way never take the advice from people that are not in the market or try to tell you not to invest. Good luck on your journey

</script><p> In the U.S. you must be at least 18. <br>
 <br>
Investigate the different investments you have available to you. Make THE BEST investment you can: Invest in yourself - your own education. Once you have that knowledge, no one can ever take it away. <br>
 <br>
In the beginning “newbie” traders &amp; investors DO NOT INVEST any money. It probably won’t be long when you’ll feel you’re ready to invest your hard-earned money. Before taking that step, you really should do research about what you are investing in. <br>
 <br>
You should LEARN HOW: <br>
A] the stock market works.    B] to invest in many, many various ways.  C] to properly trade    <br>
D] Properly manage the money in  your trading account. <br>
 <br>
&quot;Newbie&quot; investors &amp; traders ALWAYS make mistakes. In fact, throughout a person&#039;s trading, he/she makes mistakes. <br>
 <br>
In the beginning, you READ &amp; LEARN about the market &amp; how it works: Read &quot;Investing for Dummies&quot; As you read &amp; do research about the investments you are interested in, sometimes you&#039;ll come across a financial or investment term you never heard before.  <br>
http://investopedia*** is a free site. It’s recognized by Y! A as a &quot;Featured Knowledge Partner&quot;.  <br>
 <br>
You can usually find excellent, easy-to-understand definitions of many financial &amp; investment terms by going to Investopedia’s dictionary.  <br>
 <br>
It also has a free, paper trading platform. You can set up a virtual account &amp; almost trade as though you were trading with real money.  <br>
http://finance.yahoo*** is also recognized by Y! A as a &quot;Featured Knowledge Partner&quot; <br>
 <br>
THIS IS NOT SPAM: I DO NOT know this man. I am not associated w/ him in any way. I know of him &amp; the wonderful book he wrote. You should invest in a copy of  <br>
“The Richest Man in Babylon” by George S. Classon. You can get the book on http://amazon***  <br>
Its easy to read &amp; follow. You can write in it &amp; make notes in it. Simply read five [5] pages of this book - or any book - each and every day.  <br>
OR You can leave it on the shelf, on a table or on the floor &amp; let it collect dust.  <br>
 <br>
Thanks for asking your Q! I enjoyed answering it! <br>

Yes, that is my real last name!
        </p> You must be 18 to legally have your own investment account. Not because the stock market is &quot;gambling&quot; (it isn&#039;t, if you know what you&#039;re doing), but because of contract law... the bank doesn&#039;t want to get screwed out of their money. Technically if you are under 18 you can void any contract you enter in to, so you could lose all your money and then tell the bank to give you your money back... they don&#039;t like that and try to avoid it. <br>
 <br>
If you have the money and knowledge but really don&#039;t want to wait until you are 18, you can set up an &quot;in trust&quot; account by having your parents co-sign. Your bank can provide more information.
        </p> Technically there is not any age decrease - you only could desire to be alive and able to pay. A &quot;stable&quot; broking provider may even determine that there is expertise and suitability before putting a commerce for anybody, no count what the age - yet rather so for the elderly.
        </p> For the business that I invested in, you have to be at least 18 years old.
        </p> You will need a custodian on your account if you are under 18.  The younger you start the better.  Check out ***fool*** for fun, accurate advice.
        </p> to invest into a company you have to be 18 in the US since its considered gambling since your risking your money on the company and you can gain or lose money
