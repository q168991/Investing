also try buying a home in a high forclosure area but rents high thru section 8 therefore giving u your first home as an investment home and best yet it will be rented quick thru section 8 i say ditech*** for home loans they are fast and efficiant aslo if u need a cosigner make sure its someone who already has a home because if they can also apply for a home then thats 2 investments if u cosign and u both are on the title
        </p> Definitely go with mutual funds. You don&#039;t want to buy individual stocks because you could lose a lot of money. The world of stock market investing is quite complex. Might as well leave it to the experts. <br>

        </p> It actually is a good idea. You can learn a lot and find that you are more interested in current events and how they affect stock prices.  Scottrade*** is a good place to get started.  I think it&#039;s about $8 per trade regardless of how many shares. You might want to start out with mutual funds which are available on Scottrade***.  These are funds that buy into many different companies in order to lower volititlity and risk. Of course that doesn&#039;t mean the risk is zero, it&#039;s just better than if you went out and bought one or two individual companies on your own.  Look for mutual funds with low costs, these are called &quot;No-Load&quot; funds.  Read up and do your research before you dive in.  I think it&#039;s great that you&#039;re interested. This will really help you take control of your own finances.
        </p> First, I want to say that if you are new for stock market then daily trading is not good for you. Invest for a long term basis. It will be good for you and is less risky. Apart from website, business magazine is also good to understand the strategy of market. However, from a stock site its good to earn daily news and to know which fund will give you profit in the near future.
        </p> In order to invest money in the stock market, (i) you need to open a brokerage account, (ii) deposit some money in it, and then (iii) buy stocks, ETFs, or mutual funds. <br>
 <br>
However, before you do buy anything, it would be a good idea to understand how the market works, and you have researched the security you intend to buy.  You see, putting money in the market is the easy part, making money requires some work.
        </p> Penny stocks are loosely categorized companies with share prices of below $5 and with market caps of under $200 million. They are sometimes referred to as &quot;the slot machines of the equity market&quot; because of the money involved. There may be a good place for penny stocks in the portfolio of an experienced, advanced investor, however, if you follow this guide you will learn the most efficient strategies https://tr.im/c8109
        </p> first of all, when i don&#039;t have answers, i find out who does.  be an educated investor.  i have a financial adviser, i can call him any time, as many times as i want, and i don&#039;t pay for our little meetings, as long as i invest thru him.  i have used this to its fullest advantage. <br>
 <br>
find a good adviser, e-mail me for advice on that. <br>
 <br>
start out with two or three mutual funds.  individual stock trading is not for the newcomer.  get a good base with some funds.  i say one aggressive domestic fund, and one aggressive international fund  (international, not global).  you can build a base with this.   <br>
 <br>
as you get your statements, read them, even if it all looks like gibberish.  if you can, read a book on investing for beginners, and listen to the news.  again, get educated, your retirement is worth you asking questions here n there. <br>
 <br>
MOST IMPORTANT:  when you invest even $50 a month, on a set schedule, you will see the value or balance go up and down thru the years, don&#039;t let this scare you.  the number of shares, however, will never go down, only up.  keep that in mind, be patient, and make money.
        </p> Investing in stocks can be risky business. I recommend buying a mutual fund until you feel more comfortable with what you are doing.  <br>

        </p> Using expert investment advice and financial planning assists you in learning how to invest in the world stock markets, in equities and in money markets and extremely improves your investing skills.
