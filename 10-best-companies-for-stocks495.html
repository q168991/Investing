<h1>10 best companies for stocks?</h1>
<div class="answer">Hello, for a school project I need to choose 10 companies from which I can buy stocks (money isn&amp;#39;t a problem, it can be any company). I would like to include Microsoft and Google. Any technological company is best for me but any kind of company will do.
I really want to win my contest! 
Thanks so much!<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> There are a ton of good companies out there. None that I would be going long in (buying). <br>
 <br>
I have addressed this Q several times since last summer 2008. <br>
 <br>
My consistent suggestion has been to stay in cash, CD&#039;s, short term US Treasuries, or for the trader - short the S&amp;P 500 Index. This has been the ONLY correct move thus far. Trading, esp in a class game is not going to be accurate as all trades are not really entered in the market, thus not subject to real bids. <br>
 <br>
My answer would be hedged based on when the game ends. No one who has answered this Q ever answered that question. <br>
 <br>
We will have short term &quot;Bear Market Rally&#039;s&quot; but these are not times to buy but times to sell, or re-short. <br>
 <br>
So if you are thinking, &quot;well, its a game and were supposed to buy stocks.&quot; We&#039;ll, my answer is that buying stocks just because is not the reason to buy them. There are times to buy and times to sell. <br>
 <br>
By staying about 100% effective cash and perhaps a bit net short, I have suggested since I have been asked these questions that what will be more likely is that 75% or more of the class who went long and bought stocks will lose the game. <br>
 <br>
I also have said since what - 99 to 100% - of the class has no real market understanding, or experience on how trading/ investing works, therefore I&#039;d expect that the only winners will be those who allow everyone else to make the mistakes and buy stocks long and hope they go up. <br>
 <br>
Therefore, a better strategy in my view using game theory, is not to try to outperform the market, but to be cognitive of who the players are, and all you need to do is outperform them. I&#039;d rather just watch the majority of the people playing the game fail (have net principle loss at the end), thus you come out ahead. <br>
 <br>
There may be a couple people who will get lucky and excel, but I&#039;d go with the odds of the rest of the class losing their principle. Remember the real winners are those who still have their principle in tack at the end of the game.

</script><p> Google&#039;s a good one <br>
 <br>
Tech stocks:  Amazon Apple, IBM, Intel Hewlett Packard, Honeywell  <br>
 <br>
Others:  Coca Cola, Johnson &amp; Johnson, Merck &amp; Co, <br>
 <br>
These are all great for investors but if the goal is to make as much as possible, shouldn&#039;t you go for high risk/ high reward stocks if it&#039;s just with fake money?  Dangerous stocks that could double or triple your money?
        </p> Diversify.  Get something as a defense contractor, a health care  provider or pharmaceutical company,oil and gas, electricity,and maybe a little mining company.  Stay away from the banks, too shaky now.  Also try a reit.
        </p> My bet is Google. I obtained in at 222 in May, 2005 and out at 350. Missing the tremendous leg up. Hope Google is the one inventory that behaved that good for the period of the time strains in query.
        </p> If you serious to invest and make money, you must google for HSFX Asset Management and start making consistent returns monthly!
        </p> dang a hard question with the economy. walmart would be good. exxon mobil.  those are the only two i can think about right now that i don&#039;t think the economy will hurt.
