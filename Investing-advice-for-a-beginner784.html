<h1>Investing advice for a beginner?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am a 20 year old college student that can afford to invest approximately 3k. I currently have my money in a savings account that only earns .3% interest. i know that i can get a better return with a little smart investing. I just don&amp;#39;t know what my options are as of right now. I want to invest in something secure, but i am willing to take on a little risk for a greater reward. I am looking for something long term. Any ideas that will help me find a direction to go in? i dont even know where to start looking on where to invest and what to invest in.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> It looks like you want an investment with a better return with a limited downside risk. I like the Janus Short-Term Bond fund symbol JASBX. From Jan 1, 2009 to September 30, 2009 this fund was up 7.37%. This fund has never lost money in a given year.

</script><p> put some &quot;emergency&quot; money into a money market account that you can write checks off of if you need to.  The idea for this is to cover emergencies like unexpected expenses, so you can feel more confident about investing the rest of your money.  A good place to start is $1000, and then 3-6 months of your expenses.  You never touch this money for investing, just for emergencies.  A new car, or tv...is not an emergency. <br>
 <br>
Next, a good place to get educated on some basic risk/reward scenarios is with some do-it-yourself investing site like ***vanguard***. <br>
 <br>
Never, Ever...invest in single stocks only, they are too risky.   <br>
 <br>
money market, bond funds, balanced funds are some safer categories of mutual funds.  You can invest in some risky stuff too, you just dont want to get too risky, so one bad event doesn&#039;t wipe you out financially.
        </p> Rule #1: Don&#039;t invest a dime in anything, unless you know exactly what you&#039;re doing. <br>
Rule #2: Only invest money that you don&#039;t plan on spending for the next five to ten years. <br>
Rule #3: Do not invest money unless it is spare cash lying around (all the debts are paid off, and you have six months expenses already covered with cash-in-the-bank) <br>
 <br>
If you have those three covered, then the best long-term investments are with stock mutual funds. <br>
That&#039;s a bunch of people who put their money together to buy a bunch of different stocks.
        </p> The time you open a brokerage account is after a 365 days of gaining information of and records what you&#039;re stepping into. Even after that&#039;s mandatory consistently be increasing your information base. in case you do no longer make an effort to examine...... I assure an extremely intense priced experiance buying and merchandising. First 5 rules of procuring for and merchandising; understand what you&#039;re making an investment in. Have an go out plan earlier you&#039;re taking a place. consistently place length. consistently have an area. in no way take inventory tips from anybody.
        </p> This is a good blog that has great newbie advice.  Just remember to read all you can before investing any money. It&#039;s not hard to make money investing, but you do have to research some.  Good luck. <br>

        </p> im 18 iv been trading since 14, you need to do alot of research, and expect to lose some money, you need a broker, and at least $500, for short trades i would do some penny stock but not alot of your money on that, id invest in C im not in it at this moment, but am gonna get into it when it dips, always make a profit off the dips, come to stockgoodies*** we always talk about stocks choices, and our personal choices on todays stocks <br>
 <br>
im in scottrade, iv made good profits so far, just fooling around with penny stocks and doing alot of research on more $ stocks as well, i still had to do alot of research though, cant just throw money at a wall and think its going to make me money, you need $500 to start with at least, its $7 per trade not that bad most big online brokers are at like $12, and there ar no inactivity or hidden fees, i like it do your research, iv heard of sogotrade***, but have not used it it say $3 per trade and 100 free to start with, sound to good to be true, but make that choice for your self. <br>
if you go with scottrade i think you will like how it teaches you about stocks and the trading tools itself, and the local branches around the nation, like 437 or something like that, ok well here’s a code for 3 free trades with scottrade:VNQP7030 <br>
 <br>
hope it helps, if you have more questions I am a moderator for a community site kinda like face book for stock holders and researchers, its a 100% free site, non push site (we wont tell you to buy a stock to get us a gain), has a face book style design and a stock chat, its StockGoodies*** come to stock chat hope to see you there, Goodies4monkeys sent you
