Go to the library and find 8 finance and investment magazines.  Read them until you figure out which one you like the most.  Then check out a book on investing.  Maybe even the &quot;Investing for Dummies&quot; (not implying you are a dummy).  Read that book, front to rear.  Subscribe to the magazine.  Not one of them will say invest in penny stocks.

</script><p> Good questions.  Stocks can be a great way to make money over the long term. It can take 3-5 years to learn how to trade them for shorter term gains.... which ever you choose.... learn the basics first before you open an account.   Only about 5% of those people that try day trading last a year. <br>
 <br>
Some people trade bonds....I don&#039;t. I&#039;d suggest waiting a few years.  read some books. Start with; <br>

Here&#039;s an article on stock brokers; <br>

        </p> look at the stocks 5 year history.  Find one ( just for example ) which was $100 and now is $10.  Purchase that one.  Even if if goes up to half of what it used to be, you quadrupled your money.  Log onto Fidelity*** they trade mutual funds and stocks.  I prefer stocks priced in the $2-$7 range as that is what i can afford.  I look at their 5 year history and if they were at some point $30 + I buy them.  I am no millionaire but I have done well.  A lot of stocks are priced low despite prices rising.  Now is a great time to invest.  $500-$1000 would be a great start for you.  Purchase 2-3 stocks with that amount.
        </p> If you have already established a savings account with emergency funds that you can tap in the event you need them, then you may be ready for stocks. Keep in mind that funds used for this purpose should be generally long-term in nature and money you can afford to lose in the event your stocks decline in value, or in some cases become worthless. I would suggest mutual funds which are managed by professionals and invest in many stocks which lowers your risk. Lots of info out there on mutual funds. Morningstar*** is one site you can checkout, but there are many. Good luck.
        </p> To Start Investing                                                                         <br>
It takes a long time to learn the stock market and it would help if you read some books and information online.  Before you start investing in the market the first thing you need to decide is what risk level you want to take.  CDs backed up by the government has about 3-4% annual return for the long term with a low risk.  Bonds or Bonds Funds has about 5-7% annual return for the long term with a medium risk.  Stocks or Stock Mutual Funds has about 8-10% annual return for the long term with a high risk and are more volatile than Bonds. A person could make more than 10% annual return with the right investment. Usually the more risk you take, the more return you will have, but not always.  To see the Risk vs Return go to my photo:   http://i1142.photobucket***/albums/n620...   The stock market is basally made up of stocks and bonds.  Investment managers pick a group of stocks to make a mutual fund or a group of bonds to make a bond fund.  They even put a mixture of stocks and bonds together and call it a Growth &amp; Income Fund.   <br>
  <br>
1- MUTUAL FUNDS: I like mutual funds because they have a group of stocks (could be around 100+) invested in different sectors, and manage by a professional. Managers have lots of schooling for investing in stocks, around 8 years. So I think managers can pick stocks better than I can. You can make a buy or sell order anytime of the day for mutual funds shares but it will not go in affect until the close of the day. There are lots of different kinds of mutual funds that does not charge any fees to buy it&#039;s shares and they are called Noload Funds. There are also some funds called Load Funds that charge about 5% of your investment. But what I don&#039;t like is the fact that most funds has trading restriction and you may not be able to trade more than 4 times a year. That&#039;s because it makes it hard for the fund to make a good return if there is to much trading in the fund, causing the fund manager to make more buys and sells and keep more cash on hand. Mutual funds are meant for long term investors. <br>
2- STOCKS: Stocks is more volatile than funds unless you spread you money in about ten different sectors and know witch sector will do best. Stock trading restriction is only a few days and that&#039;s something that I like. If you own stocks, you will need to keep up with all the company&#039;s business so you don&#039;t get stuck with a bad stock. That could take a lots of time. I think a person that buys a few stocks is taking more risk hoping to make a bigger return. If that&#039;s the case, look at the leverage ETFs. <br>
3- ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds): ETFs are like a mutual fund but trades like a stock and that is my main reason why I like ETFs. There are some ETFs that represents Index&#039;s. An Index is like S&amp;P or DOW. Index&#039;s operate just like a mutual fund with a group of stocks in deferent sectors, manage by professionals.  You can&#039;t buy Index&#039;s because they are not for sell.  A company owns them.  But you can buy a mutual funds or an ETF that has the same stocks as the Index they represent. There are a lots of different kinds of ETFs for someone to choose from. Some have 1x leverage, some have 2x leverage for aggressive investors, and some has 3x leverage for more aggressive investors. There are some that represent almost every kind of sector.    <br>
 <br>
To buy stocks or funds, you need a broker account. You can find several good brokers that charge $8.00 and under per stock trade and no fee on Noload Funds. Most broker websites have good research tools. Some popular broker websites are Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, E-trade, Scottrade and others.  I think you need a min. of $500 (some sites $2,500) to open a broker account and need to be at lease 18 years old. If you not 18, you might could get your Dad to open an account for you. <br>
