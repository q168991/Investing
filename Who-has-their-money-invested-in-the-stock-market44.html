</script><p> Almost everyone has some money invested in the stock market if they are working. There are 401Ks, IRAs, and other pension vehicles. Then there is plain investing in stocks and bonds through extra earnings or money beyond that on which to live. That will include the Warren Buffetts, Bill Gates, the people next door and your mom and pop.
        </p> The only current investment I have in the market is my 401K...which is currently doing really bad. However, I have better then 30 years to retirement, so I&#039;m holding steady. There will be time for the market to recover. If I had the extra cash, I would invest more right now, while it&#039;s way down, and plan on reaping the benefits in the future. I might just spend my tax return on that!   <br>
 <br>
I consider myself to be middle class.
        </p> There are several middle class people with money in the stock market.  Most just put their money into their 401K or pension.  I wasn&#039;t going to invest in the stock market at all unless it was my retirement account, but now that the market has been absolutely getting destroyed, I decided to start a general investing account.  I use E*Trade.  I really like it.  It has a $10,000 minimum balance to waive the service fee, but all you have to do to avoid that is to make one trade per quarter.  I really like E*Trade&#039;s savings account as well.
        </p> Almost everyone.  Anyone with a 401(k) or an IRA should have a chunk in the market.  If they are in their 20s or 30s they should have the majority of it in the market.
        </p> a lot of middle class people have any additional retirement savings wrapped up in the stock market.
        </p> I&#039;m middle class, and i have a stock market account
        </p> about 1/2 of american families own stock in some way - through a retirement account, a pension fund, or in a brokerage account.
        </p> Listen to Snoopy. That&#039;s correct
        </p> Everyone who has money and want to take risks to make or lose more money.
        </p> My IRA is, but I have it on safe mode and it still lost a lot.
