<h1>A few questions about Investing in the stock market?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am looking to get into the stock market but there are plenty of things I don&amp;#39;t know. I&amp;#39;m doing this because I want more financial independance from my parents other than my job. My Parents have given me about $10,000 to invest but are going to moniter my actions. They told me I need to figure out everything by myself so I dont have to rely on them all thetime.nBest answer goes to the person who can most accurately answer the following questions:

1. How long must I hold stock before I can sell?

2. What is the minimum amount of Shares I can buy (like in 1 company)?

3. What online site (i.e TDAmeritrade, Scottrade, etc.) is the most user friendly?

4. Is there a minimum age limit ( I&amp;#39;m 17 but I have my own debit card)?

5. Is it best to start with smaller stocks or start by buying bigger stocks like Apple and Google (money isn&amp;#39;t an issue for me)?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> First thing you invest in is the book &quot;Investing for Dummies&quot; <br>
You can buy it in the morning and sell it at night. <br>
1 share but the transaction fees will kill you.  Best deal is to buy in lots of 100 <br>
Both are fine.   <br>
Minimum age is 18 since that is the legal age to sign a contract.  Get a parent to open a custodial account for you <br>
Money is an issue you only have 10k  Buy stock in great companies that have a smaller share price. This way your investment is spread out into a few companies and you do not loose it all if one company tanks

</script><p> 1. How long must I hold stock before I can sell? It depends, but you can hold it as long as you want. <br>
 <br>
2. What is the minimum amount of Shares I can buy (like in 1 company)? 1. <br>
 <br>
3. What online site (i.e TDAmeritrade, Scottrade, etc.) is the most user friendly? I&#039;ll let someone else answer this question. <br>
 <br>
4. Is there a minimum age limit ( I&#039;m 17 but I have my own debit card)? 18. <br>
 <br>
5. Is it best to start with smaller stocks or start by buying bigger stocks like Apple and Google (money isn&#039;t an issue for me)? Either works, although I&#039;d invest in something that&#039;s worth investing in, not randomly invest in stocks.
        </p> Learn before you burn. Go to Yahoo finance and set up a portfolio. From that try your various strategies. Set up different portfolios based on your different strategies. Investing clubs are fun. It gets other people involved and you learn from each other. When you are ready, start out with a safe and solid option, for example a Vanguard ETF or mutual fund. Next, try a stock. When one of your portfolios goes bad, figure out why it went bad. When it does well, figure that out. A year from now, what do you think the economy will be like. Will the Obama plan get more people back to work, why does employment effect the stock market? Why does the tsunami in Japan effect the stock market? Why does us bombing Libya effect the stock market?
