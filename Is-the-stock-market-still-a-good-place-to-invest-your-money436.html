</script><p> I´ve been investing for more than 20 years and trading for almost 14, and I can tell you that if you want to make BIG and FAST profits, I recommend you trading rather than investing, trading can help you to go from rags to rich. <br>
 <br>
If you are investing, you must have already achieved some degree of financial success, long term stock investing and FOREX can help you become much richer than you are today. <br>
 <br>
My experiences as a Nasdaq Market Maker, Head trader of several brokerage firms, and currently as a professional trader and private hedge fund manager, I can suggest you that: <br>
 <br>
We trade because we want quick, short term profits on a consistent basis. We want to cash flow the market. Milk it like a cow. <br>
 <br>
Make consistent, small, short term gains rather than trying to hit a home run on every trade. Don&#039;t ever forget that. <br>
Don&#039;t marry a stock, marry the idea of making money trading stocks. That&#039;s the only way to do it. <br>
 <br>
For me &quot;All stocks are equally worthless” <br>
 <br>
I don&#039;t hold on to any illusion that the stock market will continue to go up and provide a nice retirement for me. <br>
I could care less which way the market goes. It&#039;s irrelevant to me if the market goes higher, crashes or moves sideways for the next 50 years. I really could care less. Stocks are just four letters with two prices next to them that I use to make a living trading. <br>
 <br>
Trade ONLY when you have a clear, easy and identifiable advantage, because without a CLEAR EDGE your odds of success are NO better than a flip of a coin… That´s why so many new traders (and investors) lose money. <br>
 <br>
Take a look at any daily chart of any index or stock and you&#039;ll probably see the most volatility and the biggest opportunity for profit during the first Hour of the stock market&#039;s opening. <br>
 <br>
The popular thinking and conventional wisdom is that you should wait about an hour before you start trading. <br>
 <br>
But if you do, you&#039;ll miss the big, fast moves that stocks make as all the amateurs let their emotions out through their <br>
online accounts, usually right after they read some news headline or hear Maria Bartiromo go off about a stock on CNBC. <br>
 <br>
It&#039;s easy to see why trading the open is the market&#039;s prime time for profiting from other online traders. <br>
The market&#039;s open is very volatile - that is the perfect environment for LARGE, FAST profits. <br>
 <br>
Learn to trade as a professional Market Maker ,not as an emotionally driven amateur trader or investor with few thousand dollars in an account at Etrade. <br>
 <br>
There isn&#039;t any other time during the day or any stock you can invest in, that can make you 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 or more points <br>
in minutes OTHER than during the first hour the stock market is open. That&#039;s why I love trading the open so much. <br>
 <br>
I trade only when I have an edge and that means &quot;only the first hour the market is open&quot;. <br>
 <br>
If you are a beginning trader, you can give yourself an unfair advantage in the market trading this way. <br>
 <br>
I can carry on with the advises about how to make money trading, but if you ask me: <br>
 <br>
&quot;What is the best thing you can do for me? <br>
 <br>
I will say: <br>
 <br>
Give yourself a BIG favor and go to this &quot;Top Secret&quot; site and learn how to get the BEST stocks that will make the largest and fastest day trading profits you´ve ever seen... <br>
 <br>
***onehourtrading*** <br>
 <br>
After you review this site you won´t need system, strategy, book, software or mentor to tell you what to do, <br>
you will be able to profit HUGE every day. <br>
 <br>
Good luck and good trading, <br>
 <br>

</script><p> Probably the best place to invest your money.  With some caveats.  Historically, the stock market has returned about 11-14%; bonds about 5%; savings accounts, well 1-2% (if that).  Factor inflation robbing you of 3-5% and your real returns drop to 6-9%, 0-3%, and negative 4-6% (which means you are LOSING money by saving. <br>
 <br>
Suggestion:  Pay off all high interest credit card debt; start an emergency contingency fund (2-3 months emergency cash in a bank or money market fund with check writing  privileges; educate yourself online (start with Vanguard http://***vanguard***) and go from there.  Read the Boggleheads Guide to Investing. <br>
 <br>
Start with an index Mutual Fund and invest regularly and watch your money grow.  There will be ups and downs but with a low cost mutual fund you will spread your investment over 100-500 or more stocks.  And while you will never initially hit a home run you will also probably not strike out either.  As your portfolio grows and your understanding of the stock market increases, you could add other mutual funds (international, real estate, energy, etc) or invest in a stock or two you have thoroughly researched. <br>
 <br>
Get started now and reap the rewards of compound growth.  Learn about it at: http://***moneychimp***/calculator/com... <br>
 <br>
Good luck; it&#039;s a good choice!
        </p> The stock market is usually I good place to invest your money, only if you know what you are doing. Currently things are still a little unsteady due to something that you may have heard about called the Credit Crunch. A lot of drastic measures have been taken by our colonial cousins across the pond and the real results of these, in my opinion, have yet to be fully realised. Other factors like Oil and the price of wheat are making economies a little shaky generally. But in the future, a day will come where the market will be the only place a realistic investor would be looking to put his money. The markets go in cycles, sometimes up, sometimes down. You just have to be ready for when it goes up. As for being successful, there are no easy quick fix answers. I suggest a healthy course of reading trading methods and strategies, a few biographies of successful traders (you need to read about Warren Buffet) and a lot of time checking, preferably every day at what the markets are doing, how news is affecting share prices, what people are saying about companies, wider economic conditions, etc. A good easy introduction into share trading would be a book called &#039;The Naked Trader&#039;. Good luck.
        </p> Sure, you can make money on volatility...but the market is too unpredictable these days!?! Even gold has gone down drastically...as did Crude Oil...and the Dow had another unexpected and record breaking plunge!! The thing is, the market is completely dependent on political and economic reports which keep giving out negative news and hitting the market trends and moods hard and bad.... For the long term, its also a perfect opportune time to buy stocks into solid companies that will undoubtedly rebound big time post-crisis; but even the surest financial institutions are unsafe right now... For the short term...you&#039;re better off keeping your money under your mattress ;p
        </p> The stock is ok to invest you money in if you know anything abt stocks. <br>
my best idea would be to save a 3-5thousand and go to a bank that has high interest rates on CD&#039;s. <br>
I started when i was 18yrs old it had 9% interest and i nearly gain 6times of what i put in there and i am only 22.
        </p> A common misconception is that you will have to be a financial and business expert in order to successfully trade binary options. However, this is not true at all. Learn here https://tr.im/8YU3W  <br>
 <br>
Perhaps it’s true when it comes to traditional stocks trading but definitely not true in the case of binaries. You don’t have to be an expert to predict the movement of certain assets.

        </p> yes it sure is. because even thogh it may not seem like your getting as much back, its still a matter of thinking smartly and buying low seling high. You still would get relatively the same amount of capitol gain in the outcome if your smart about it.
