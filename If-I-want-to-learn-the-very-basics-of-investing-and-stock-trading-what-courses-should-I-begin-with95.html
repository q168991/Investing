<h1>If I want to learn the very basics of investing and stock trading what courses should I begin with?</h1>
<div class="answer">I&amp;#39;m not currently interested in a career in business, but I think knowing and using the skills involved in it to trade stocks, manage investments, and all of the other things I&amp;#39;m not aware of yet will be a huge payoff in the long run. So, any tips on what kind of classes (or maybe books) I should take to get started? Also, about how much time will I need to spend learning the basics before I can begin profitably trading and investing?

</script><p> Go get a book from a library or a bookstore. <br>
Such as: <br>
Investing for Dummies <br>
Investing Made Easy <br>
The Idiot&#039;s Guide to Investing. <br>
 <br>
These are not insults.  These are fantastic books. <br>
Short chapters that will break down everything simply. <br>
No long winded reading. <br>
A book like this would be used over and over in your life.  You will reference it.

</script><p> Take a look at some good books out there on investing. There is a lot of literature on Warren Buffet, Peter Lynch, and others. Study the greats if you want to become one. Check out Amazon!  <br>
 <br>
You can learn the basics in a day if you are really motivated but don&#039;t expect to get rich over night. Investing takes a lot of discipline and some luck. Don&#039;t rush into buying stocks right away. You have a lot of studying to do before that.  <br>
 <br>
You can use as an additional resource stockmarketmate***  <br>
 <br>
When you start, start with a small amount of money until you get acquainted with trading. Good luck!
