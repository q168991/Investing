<h1>How should I  start investing my money?</h1>
<div class="answer">Im a 21 year old male and I have always wanted my money to work for me instead of me working for my money.

</script><p> First, my questions:  <br>
i.    How much money do you have to invest? <br>
ii.   What degree of risk are you willing to take? <br>
iii.   How long are you willing to wait for the return? <br>
iv.   Are you willing to share any great investing opportunity you     <br>
      get with other investors? <br>
 <br>
Now, my suggestions: <br>
i.   You must have at a least a few K&#039;s to get started, but a min of <br>
     1 K will do. <br>
ii.   If you are a low risk taker, then look for the low return  <br>
      investment involving longer time. High risk = High return <br>
iii.  Short term = High risk, Long term = Low risk <br>
iv.  Share with others and earn on leverage. <br>
 <br>
If you agree with my suggestion, you might get the right answer from the website below. <br>
 <br>
Good Luck.

</script><p> Educate yourself thoroughly about the type of investment you have in mind.  This will (eventually) enable you to make your own informed decisions instead of relying on a supposed &quot;expert&quot; to handle investments for you.  Be patient in this process: do not commit real money until you are genuinely convinced that you know what you are doing.  If you choose to invest in stocks via a mutual fund so that you will not have to do research in great detail, at least spend the time and effort necessary to research mutual funds thoroughly.  It is not only their past performances that have significant differences.
        </p> I have  a 401k  at work check into a 401k  where you work . Also I have a IRA and a CD at the bank which I use. The IRA to me is the best but your 401k can be taken out anytime if you ever had to have some money. My aunt has a money market also she buys stock right know Oil would be the best stock to buy I guess my aunt had some oil stock she bought over 10 years ago and when oil prices went to 2,3 &amp; 4 dollars a gallon she made ALOT off of her stock in oil. the thing about that is buy Stock Low and sell when  it goes High. Hope this help. I would go with a CD &amp; IRA if you can&#039;t get a 401k
        </p> Buy the Canadian Bank Shares. These shares trade on the NYSE and on the TSE. These shares have on average produced an annualized return in the 12% range. The great part about these companies is that they have a very high return on invested capital. In the end this is what counts because the stock will follow the profits that a company produces.
        </p> The investment ideas depend on the amount to be invested.  This could be on regular basis or in one lot.  If the amount is small or u donot have the time to study, mutual funds will be the right choice.  U can go thru the Yahoo finance page for ideas on mf.
        </p> Start looking at Mutual funds. Depending which country you live there are lots of information on Mutual funds on Internet .The return, performance, objectives etc. Stick with the reputable funds and think of investing for long term. <br>
If you are in Canada I advise you to look at this site. <br>

        </p> hi danny, currently there is one of the best investment product available in the market is to invest in a freehold plot in U.K. (currently we have one land in London for investment).  Each plot is 576sq.ft and it costs only UK Pounds 5,625.00 and in 3 to 4 years time, we buy-back your plot at a very high market price after Planning Permission is obtained from Land Department.  The profit margin minimum you can take home after selling your plot to us is around 338% (within 3 to 4 years).  Is it interesting for you?  Where do u stay? I could send all relevant details if interested. Pls email me at sgdeen@yahoo***.sg
        </p> Only invest what you can afford to lose. <br>
 <br>
Independant financial advisor is the way to go, though. <br>
 <br>
Bear in mind that people who get paid millions of dollars a year, and spend all day every day looking at the markets, still lose it all and make mistakes.
        </p> A diversified portfolio gives good long term results.  Maybe start with a few mutual funds with different investment objectives, such as a small cap fund such as FUND,  a chinese fund such as TDF,  and a large cap fund.
        </p> invest in a real estate Mutual fund. i did, and its great
