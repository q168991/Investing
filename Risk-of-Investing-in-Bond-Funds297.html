</script><p> It depends on what kind of bonds are being held in the portfolio, rating on the bonds, whether they are insured, and by whom, whether they are leveraged and by how much. <br>
 <br>
From the SEC: <br>
&quot;A common misconception among some investors is that bonds and bond funds have little or no risk. Like any investment, bond funds are subject to a number of investment risks including: <br>
 <br>
   1. &quot;Credit risk&quot;  This is the risk that the issuers of the bonds owned by a fund may default (fail to pay the debt that they owe on the bonds that they have issued). This risk may be minimal for funds that invest in insured or U.S. Government bonds. <br>
 <br>
   2. &quot;Prepayment risk&quot;  This is the risk that the issuers of the bonds owned by a fund will prepay them at a time when interest rates have declined. Because interest rates have declined, the fund may have to reinvest the proceeds in bonds with lower interest rates, which can reduce the fund’s return. (Not all bonds, however, can be prepaid.) <br>
 <br>
   3. &quot;Interest rate risk&quot;  This is the risk that the market value of the bonds owned by a fund will fluctuate as interest rates go up and down. Nearly all bond funds are subject to this type of risk, but funds holding bonds with longer maturities are more subject to this risk than funds holding bonds with shorter maturities. Because of this type of risk, you can lose money in a bond fund, including those that invest only in insured bonds or government bonds.&quot; <br>
 <br>
Commentary: <br>
Why I don&#039;t like bond funds. <br>
1. No maturity dates. <br>
2. You don&#039;t own the bonds. You own a fund that owns the bonds. You own shares in the fund. Not the same. I prefer direct ownership.

</script><p> Junk bond funds are the riskiest. Bonds are meant for predictable income, not risk. Bond funds come with diversification, which means more security from any one bond defaulting on payment. Bond funds aren&#039;t that risky. They do however pay a dividend like a stock fund does. It doesn&#039;t pay a full amount as opposed to an individual bond. Most retirement plans consist of bond funds.
        </p> certainly, greater yield is a reward for greater threat, as desperate by the industry. The extra a bond fund yields, the riskier the element bonds. additionally, there are diverse varieties of threat. With company bonds, there is the threat of default. With maximum bonds of any form, you threat having inflation erode the linked fee of your income --- an incredibly genuine threat in a bond fund it fairly is in any different case rock sturdy! on the 2d, I incredibly have a great allocation in leading edge&#039;s fund of information, Treasury Inflation risk-free Securities, that are subsidized by, as they say, the entire faith and credit of the U.S. government, with the further income of paying extra beneficial to atone for any inflation, regardless of that fee of inflation ought to become. VIPSX is the ticker image. on account that Republicans and Democrats have recently shown that neither social gathering can restrain spending, and that Republicans are even much less to blame approximately paying the rustic&#039;s expenses than Democrats (by no skill theory i could say that!), inflation would be looming in a huge way. perhaps.

I really don&#039;t know a lot about bonds, all I can tell you is that my money people haven&#039;t put any of my money into bonds as far as I know. <br>
They are probably like any money investment depends on what it is.
