<div class="answer">what magazines or papers or books have u read on stocks that are really useful  

I&amp;#39;m reading MONEY TODAY and some O&amp;#39;Neils book on investing basics n donald trumps book<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> The William O&#039;Neil book &quot;How to make money in Stocks&quot; I believe is the name is excellent.  &quot;The Intelligent Investor&quot; Ben Graham is a classic. &quot;One up on Wall Street&quot; Peter Lynch is worth reading.  &quot;Contrarian Investment Strategies&quot; David Dremen is also helpful.  The hardest thing to do is to avoid getting swept along with the crowd.  I find the popular magazines like Money to be not only of little use, but actually a very bad way to get investment ideas since millions of other people are reading the same thing and the ideas are usually for stocks that have already outperformed.  CNBC is also a poor way to get financial information as they are constantly pumping the market shamelessly.  If you live near a good public library, I would go and look through the entire investment section and try to read as much as possible on all asset classes of investing.  You might decide you prefer bonds to stocks or preferred stocks to mutual fund investing.  You might like to use ETFs to diversify as you can buy almost any sector of the market or region internationally or commodities or broad market exposure using this vehicle.  I like the site ***etfconnect*** a lot for initial research on ETFs.  Good luck and remember that experience is always the best teacher.
        </p> Literature on investments is vast--both journals and books.  Choice would depend upon the level of background you already possess.  however, if you are building up one, then the following books can be helpful: <br>
1. John M. Dalton (Ed): How the Stock Market Works <br>
2. David M. Weiss: After the Trade is Made--processing securities transactions. <br>
A little up in coverage and treatment: <br>
Fischer &amp; Jordan: Security Analysis and Portfolio Management <br>
And advanced treatment and a good text: <br>
Sharpe, Alexander &amp; Bailey: Investments <br>
Read them on and you will then begin doing what I am now doing for you.
        </p> The Intelligent Investor  <br>
 <br>
Security Analysis  <br>
 <br>
The Essays of Warren E. Buffet: Lessons for Corporate America
        </p> The book &quot;Common Stocks and Uncommon Profits&quot;, by Philip Fisher. <br>
 <br>
Warren Buffett ascribes to his methods.
        </p> Usually the Wall Street Journal and BusinessWeek give me the authoritive stuff when I hear stories about this company or that.  You can get sucked into all sorts of tales and schemes, so when I want to &#039;come down to earth&#039;, I consult at least these two.
        </p> Yes my friend. Just like Dalal Street, Chaanakya, Investor, Infoindia etc,
        </p> Keep up with Kiplingers magazine
        </p> &quot;More Wealth Without Risk&quot; by Charles Givens.
        </p> I would suggest you to check the website below to learn more on shares and stock trading and how to select the best shares for investing. <br>
Hope it helps. <br>
