</script><p> buy mer when its less than 52.50 <br>
buy citibank if it is less than 25 (this would be an awesome buy) <br>
buy gu when its 11.00 or under..not a penny more. <br>
pbr-buy around less than 110 <br>
agu-buy less than 60 bucks <br>

If you have the option of shorting, that&#039;s definately something to consider in a bear market. Shorting is when you sell stocks that you don&#039;t own, and then buy it back at a lower price... you do it if you expect a stock price to go down. If you want to take a crazy risk and go all-or-nothing, short Yahoo (YHOO.) You will either be up 50% or down 50% within a few weeks. <br>
 <br>
Other companies that would make good buys... <br>
HPQ (Hewlitt Packard) <br>
GE (General Electric) <br>
NT (Nortel) -- Risky though <br>
EEM - Emerging markets ETF <br>
EWZ - Brazil ETF <br>
NCX - Nova Chemicals <br>
EFA - Europe &amp; Far East <br>
QQQQ if you think the NASDAQ will go up, buy QID if you think it will go down. <br>
 <br>
FXI - China ETF <br>
 <br>
One that I just started watching is AHR, 16% dividend and I think it has good potential, but like I said not totally sure yet. <br>
 <br>
If you can buy Canadian stocks on the TSX... <br>
BBD.B (Bombardier) <br>
PNP (Pinetree Capital) <br>
NCX (Nova Chemicals) <br>
XFN - Financials index <br>
 <br>
If you want a penny stock, MGOA (Megola) is a good buy right now. <br>
 <br>
Let me know if you want to know specific prices I would recommend selling each of the above at.
        </p> This is not the greatest time in the world to be investing in stocks.  The winner might very well be the one that looses the least.  But since it is only a game, I will suggest a couple for you.   <br>
 <br>
GIM  This is a closed end fund that invests in foreign government debt.  The hypothesis here is as the U S continues to cut interest rates, foreign soveriegn debt become more valuable.  Also as the value of the dollar continues to drop, assets denominated in foreign currencies also become more valuable.  This pays a dividend monthly.  Be sure to take the dividend into account when calculating your return.   <br>
 <br>
ETP This is a pipeline limited partnership.  Its value is somewhat cushioned by the high dividend payment.  It has also been trending up recently as alternate sources of income have deminished greatly.   <br>
 <br>
Now for a somewhat speculative one.  CAF.  This is a fund that invests in China A shares.  It is currently selling a distressed levels,  very distressed levels.  If there should be a rally, this one could go up considerably.  It is selling at 30% below net assets.  That means it is worth currently 30% than it is selling for.
        </p> First, I want to say that if you are new for stock market then daily trading is not good for you. Invest for a long term basis. It will be good for you and is less risky. Apart from website, business magazine is also good to understand the strategy of market. However, from a stock site its good to earn daily news and to know which fund will give you profit in the near future.
        </p> One of the best places to get information on companies is the library. Don&#039;t hesitate to ask the librarian to help you. There are many references such as Moody,Money Magazine,Wall St. Journal, and so on. You will only get opinions on whether the stock will go up. It&#039;s not for sure. You can also ask any body that you know that plays the market. <br>
Remember &quot;Buy low and sell high&quot;.
