</script><p> There are three ways of investing in Stock markets. <br>
[1] Direct Investment - You purchase stocks in the stock market at low price and sell them at high price  - Short Term/Medium/Long Term (or) you trade Futures &amp; Options contract with the help of Technical analysis - This would be short term trading <br>
[2] Indirect Investment Type 1 - You purchase Equity Mutual fund units. The mutual fund will invest in stock market on behalf of you. <br>
[3] Indirect Investment Type 2 - You purchase Unit linked Insurance products operated by Insurance companies. Besides covering for your life, these products will put your money in stock markets for appreciation. <br>
 <br>
For a new comer, I would suggest an SIP in Mutual funds.
        </p> Sir what you need is an investment consultant or an investment firm that offers advice. There are so many options you can take in that and it takes a discussion with someone who is professional in that industry to find out what your short and long term financial goals are to be able to give you a &quot;perfect answer in detail&quot; and even then it&#039;s not a guarantee as the market fluctuates all the time. If you want no or little risk you may want to look at cd&#039;s or money market funds. you should really talk to someone in the industry. try calling charles schwab .. they can help get you started
        </p> First, I want to say that if you are new for stock market then daily trading is not good for you. Invest for a long term basis. It will be good for you and is less risky. Apart from website, business magazine is also good to understand the strategy of market. However, from a stock site its good to earn daily news and to know which fund will give you profit in the near future.
        </p> this is depend on many points: <br>
1- if the market is efficient or not. <br>
2- how much money do u have <br>
3- your knowledge at this field <br>
4- if u wanna become long or short investor <br>
 <br>
but all of all, you have to make a diversed portfolio with the appropriate risk you like, and also you have choose the company carefully........

        </p> 1. Get PAN <br>
2. Open De-mat a/c <br>
3. Apply in best IPO <br>
4. Purchase top co. shares from market <br>
