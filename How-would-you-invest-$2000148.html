</script><p> I would open an Etrade account and put $1k in their &quot;Savings Account&quot; it will make you 5.05% and you can pull it out at any time. Then I&#039;d put the other $1k into the stock market, maybe buy Apple -(AAPL) (or maybe a home builder stock like KBH or TOL).

 <br>
Best investment: YOURSELF!! <br>
Take classes to improve yourself and your knowledge (i.e. Masters Degree). Improves marketability also! <br>
 <br>
Disagree with the guy who said 30 yr bonds. Doesn&#039;t know what he&#039;s talking about. Remember this about bonds... the longer the holding period, the higher the risk (i.e. Finance 101 - interest rate risk! Not many traders/investors buy greater than 15 yr bonds!!) <br>
Can&#039;t buy much bonds with $2k anyway. <br>
 <br>
BASIC QUESTION FOR ALL INVESTORS: <br>
How&#039;s your risk?? <br>
Simple question but usually complex answers! <br>
 <br>
Now, with $2k, you could simply invest in an IRA/Roth IRA account.  <br>
 <br>
You can invest in a mutual fund or a high interest-bearing MMKT account. <br>
 <br>
Problems.... <br>
You never stated when you need the money. Will you need the money sometime in the next month or so to pay for expenses? <br>
Consider liquidity issues! <br>
 <br>
Also, $2k is really not enough to invest in anything substantial BUT it is a good start! <br>

        </p> Get an ING Direct savings account, it has pretty good interest and it&#039;s very safe. If you are looking to make lots of money from it, invest in stocks and bonds. Or you could start a home business. You should go to my website. http://shannon.myteamonthego***/ just enter your information on the next page and I&#039;ll email you. Don&#039;t worry, nobody will call you about it.
        </p> It&#039;s probably only worth putting in a ISA or Bond it&#039;s not really a significant amount for an experienced investor to take seriously.
        </p> to be safe go with govorment bonds or mutual funds. to actually make money, take 300 of that 2k and get some stock marjet books and learn the market, after a fe months put 500 in the market and invest and make money
        </p> If you are willing to wait for your investment to pay off, invest in a 30 year bond. Bonds are the safest investment and have a decent pay off
        </p> To tell you the truth the best investment is in yourself, put it in your saving account until you get more money and open your self a business. From there its up to you what you&#039;ll do with it. -Good Luck-
        </p> Just do the research first before investing on anything,sometimes their are conartist or scams
