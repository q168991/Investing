<h1>How to invest in Indian Mutual Funds Online?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am looking for an easy way to make investments in the best performing mutual funds from India.
Basically I want an online account that allows me to not only invest lumsum but gives me an ability to invest through SIPs - systematic investment plans in funds like: HDFC, KOTAK, ICICI, FIDELITY, SBI, HDFC, etc.

Can anyone let me know how can I buy/sell or purchase mutual funds units online and manage my investment solution completely online?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Below are the point that an NRI need to keep in mind while investing in mutual funds <br>
 <br>
    All investments made by NRIs have to be in local currency. Mutual funds in India are not allowed to accept investments in foreign currency. <br>
    For investing in Indian mutual funds, therefore, an NRI needs to open one of the three bank accounts- Non-resident external rupee (NRE) account, non-resident ordinary rupee (NRO) account or foreign currency non-resident account (FCNR)-with an Indian bank. <br>
    The amount that is to be invested can be directly debited from an NRE/NRO account or received by inward remittances through normal banking channels.
        </p> Mutual fund is good option for investing money in India.
