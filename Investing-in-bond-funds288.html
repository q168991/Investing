</script><p> Bonds are you lending your money to a company or government, which will pay you back dividends on it for using your money. They are more stable, but if a company does very well and is making a lot of profit, you don&#039;t share in it - you only get what the bond is pledged to pay you. <br>
 <br>
Typically people buy bonds when: <br>
 <br>
1) There is a low tolerance for risk. <br>
 <br>
2) The period of investment is less than 5 years. <br>
 <br>
3) The markets are chaotic or going down. <br>
 <br>
4) Getting dividends is more important than long term growth. <br>
 <br>
A lot depends on how you want to invest your money. Like stocks, there are more conservative as well as more aggressive investments - but bonds are less volatile than stocks. And contrary to what you might have heard, bonds can carry risk as well, such as risk of default, and inflation. Government bonds are safest, but naturally have the lowest returns. High Yield Corporate bonds are essentially better grade junk-bonds with more risk. If you are interested in the former, try looking at ***savingsbond.gov <br>
But if you want something with better returns with low to moderate risk, look at GNMA, a Total Bond Index Fund, various tax-exempt bond funds (especially if you are in a higher tax bracket), or the High Yield Corporate. Some discount places are Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, and Schwab. <br>
 Generally if you are not close to retirement and have more than 10 years to invest, stocks are often a better choice and will outperform bonds over time. You might consider a more conservative stock investment (which also pays dividends, like around 1.75%) such as the Total Stock Market Infex Fund or S&amp;P 500 Fund. Pick a place with a no-load and low fees, like Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, and Schwab. Avoid the big banks like the plague. Don&#039;t let them rip you off with loads (sales charges) and fees. Check how much the company charges you as an expense ratio. A good one might charge you 0.2-0.8 %. If they charge more than 1% than go somewhere else. <br>

and play with it, comparing funds with more or less risk.

</script><p> At this moment in time, bonds might encompass more risk than you might think prudent.  Interest rates are artificially low because the Fed is giving money away to bail out all the dead beats.  That can not go on too much longer, maybe two years at most.  When it is over bond prices are going to drop like lead balloons, Myth Busters not withstanding. If you are not a risk taker stick with CDs.  If you are a long term investor, think instead KO, MCD, PG, CVX, GE.  They all pay dividends that are greater than 10 year bond rates and they all raise their dividends every year except for GE and CVX, but they might very well from here on out.
        </p> Bonds are debt, only lend to the ones with good credit ratings. Payments or dividends is paid quarterly or biannual and is usually link to your savings account  <br>
Look for the the 10 year benchmark and see if its at least higher than the inflation rate. <br>
 <br>
Go for fixed rate
