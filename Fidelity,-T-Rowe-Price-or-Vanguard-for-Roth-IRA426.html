<h1>Fidelity, T Rowe Price or Vanguard for Roth IRA?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am planning to open a Roth IRA before this year ends, I’m 25 year-old and plan to invest in one of those target date retirement, is that a good idea or should I make up my own portfolio consisted of all stocks since I’m still young?  In addition, I’m debating of where to open my account between Vanguard, Fidelity and T Rowe Price.  I see that Vanguard has the lowest expense ratio, but what about their performance?  Where should I have my account open?  Please share your experience.  Thanks!<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> They all have some excellent funds but not all of the funds at each of the companies are excellent, only some.  I do not personally think that it matters which you choose.  If you do choose a target date retirement fund, you will miss out on the fun of choosing which funds to invest in.  Investing actually can be fun.  Personally, I would rather pick my own funds and have the option of choosing whether to invest my money in foreign stocks, U S stocks, large cap, small cap, or bonds.  But many young investors have a tendency to go for broke when they are picking mutual funds.  Many of them did go broke as a result in 2001-2003 when their go for broke funds went broke.  So picking a target date retirement fund means you leave the choice of investment allocation to someone who is not so likely to use a daring strategy.  I do have one criticism of the target date funds however.  They are way over allocated to U S stock holdings.   To me that is extremely risky.  The Vanguard 2050 is 72% U S stocks for example. <br>
Fidelity 69%.  T Rowe Price 64%.  Personally I think about 40% is about the maximum that should be invested in U S equities.  The U S economy is not the most healthy on the face of the Earth.

        </p> I personally use Fidelity and I really like their service.  I don&#039;t think that there is a material difference between the companies.  They are all very large, secure, no-load companies.  If you check out the web site for the three fund families that you mentioned, they will all most definitely have a link that talks about all of their 4 &amp; 5 star rated (Morningstar Rating) funds.  You may want to choose the fund family that has the most highly rated funds over a broad spectrum of investments.  That is why I like fidelity. <br>
 <br>
Most of the target retirement date mutual funds invest the majority of the assests in mutual funds of the same mutual fund family.  In this respect, it is probably better to pick the family that has the largest and most diverse portolio of funds.  It is a very good investment choice for a small investor. <br>
 <br>
Try to also pick a family or service that will offer you options down the road.  I know you can invest in stocks, bonds, and annuities with Fidelity, I&#039;m not sure about T.Rowe and Vanguard.  My point is, you my want that feature in five years. <br>
 <br>
I strongly encourage you to investigate the websites for all three.  Ask yourself what kind of research and analysis features they offer you.  If you are 25 and saving for retirement, you&#039;re already a leg up on most Americans.  Down the road, you&#039;ll want many of those features.

I am planning to open a Roth IRA before this year ends, I’m 25 year-old and plan to invest in one of those target date retirement, is that a good idea or should I make up my own portfolio consisted of all stocks since I’m still young?  In addition, I’m debating of where to open my account between...
        </p> Vanguard has the highest customer service rating off all the mutual fund companies.... <br>
I dont know much about fidelity, but t.rowe price tends to have funds that arent so much indexed as vanguard does.  <br>
So if you dont mind an index fund go with vanguard..if you want something special, t.rowe price should have it.... <br>
 <br>
at some point you may or may not want both..i have my largest chunk in vanguard, but i do have a small fund or 2 in t.rowe price.
        </p> I can only echo the other answers.  All three of these companies have an excellent reputation for offering high quality, low cost mutual funds.  My money is currently in Vanguard, but I have owned both Fidelity and T Rowe Price funds in the past.  I have no complaints about any of these companies.  I suggest you base your choice by researching the various mutual funds they offer and simply pick the one(s) you like the best.  For example, I have heard good things about T Rowe Price&#039;s target date retirement funds.
        </p> I have money with each of the three companies you mentioned.  I started with Fidelity because they are the largest mutual fund company.  T Rowe Price had the best performance in the small cap value fund that I wanted.  Vanguard has the best cost structure. <br>
 <br>
The decision to make about mutual funds versus building your own stock portfolio should be determined by your time/skill requirements.  If you enjoy researching stocks and have the time/inclination to do it, do it.  Each mutual fund company has a brokerage arm to it. <br>
 <br>
If you are going to go with index funds, go with Vanguard because each index fund should have approximately the same return minus operating costs. <br>
 <br>
I started with mutual funds then expanded to individual stocks once I got some understanding of how the stock markets work and what it can do for my retirement account.
        </p> All have good funds for your Roth.  That said, <br>
it is sometimes easier to use one of the above fund families; they will help you allocate properly.  As for opening your account.  Something like Ameritrade will work nicely if you use several different fund families.  But if you use Vanguard, for example, just open the account at Vanguard.  Check out website moneyrec***, too-- lots of info and reviews written about funds with these companies.  Also, ask your questions.  Good luck and hope this helps <br>

        </p> Expenses are very important in determining your net return over long periods of time.  In the long run, very few (maybe 1 in 20) mutual funds will outpace their respective index by a significant margin.  And, any shortfall of the average return will be further worsened by the fees paid out of fund shareholder&#039;s pockets (loads, high expense ratios, 12b-1 fees, the transaction costs of portfolio turnover), causing the majority of mutual fund investors to capture only a fraction  of the total wealth that is there for the taking.  The sensible alternative is to use low-cost index mutual funds.  Play &quot;the par&quot; and keep more of what is rightfully yours.  In doing so, you will probably outperform most of your peers. <br>
 <br>
Don&#039;t think costs are important?  Spend 25 minutes reading my chapter on costs.  It is chapter 19 of my free book, located at http://***invest-for-retirement*** .  Or, don&#039;t read it.  I don&#039;t care.  I make no money from it anyway. <br>
 <br>
As far as performance is concerned, I will give you two statements to ponder: <br>
 <br>
1)  Past performance is about as useful as reading tea-leaves for predicting future performance.  Morningstar rating mean ABSOLUTELTY NOTHING when selecting your funds. <br>
 <br>
2)  Index funds always give returns consistent with the average (minus some small expenses), such that you will not need to worry about how well it has performed or will perform in the future. <br>
 <br>
Personally, I use the Vanguard Target Date 2035 Fund for my Roth IRA.  The Fidelity Freedom funds are a pretty decent choice, but are very complex, investing in 15+ underlying funds, all of them actively-managed with higher turnover than a pure index fund. <br>
 <br>
As a fund investor, you put up all of the money and shoulder all of the risk.  Therefore, who do you think is entitled to the majority of the total wealth provided by the stock and bond markets?  The fund managers, the brokerages, the brokers, the government, or you?

         Like some people have said already, the companies are so very similar.... I trade for about 6 different people ( family and friends) all with Fidelity... their site is easy to use, shows all the info you need to keep track, to research, compare etc. They have funds from many, many different companies that are &quot; no-fee&quot; for transactions. Plus there are phone numbers to contact a rep...and get info sent or some advice. <br>
Now, here&#039;s my advice...( and I agree with &quot; the birder&quot;) just do a little reading on a few nights or a rainy weekend...you will be able to select a fund or two that will outshine the &quot; target funds&quot;..(.they are all soooooo verrry conservative)... <br>
If you absolutely have to be cautious...look to a couple of &quot; balanced funds&quot;... but get some &quot; international&quot; exposure...  <br>
maybe FGBLX... a &quot; global &quot; fund from Fidelity that is a little conservative. <br>
At your young age, you should be a little more aggressive...you have years and years to recover from minor setbacks....but nice returns above the 12%/ 14% area will give your nestegg quite a jump start... <br>
Get conservative when you have profits to &quot; protect&quot;... down the road 10 to 15 years from now. <br>
Go with aggressive funds for awhile...maybe an ETF or two...then get into individual stocks if you really want to...but a couple of good funds/ETF&#039;s will get you where you want to be. <br>
Good luck.
        </p> Hi, <br>
I&#039;ve been trading the market for just a few months. My cousin actually told me about this website ( http://pennystocks.toptips.org ) and I signed up immediately after. This is my honest review about their method. I&#039;m not someone who has a lot of time to be researching for ideas because I work many hours. they made it incredibly easy for me to make money in the market. Their reports are easy to read and follow. I&#039;ve tracked most of the stock ideas that I&#039;ve received in my e-mail from them and MANY have seen some nice gains after their announcements. I&#039;ve made a nice profit (55% return on my investment on one, and 112% on the other!) on a couple of suggestions he&#039;s given and plan to start trading his ideas a lot more.  <br>
 <br>
For more info: http://pennystocks.toptips.org <br>
Bye Bye
        </p> Any of them will serve you well and have a wide variety of funds and services available.  I&#039;m with T. Rowe Price and have been very happy with them.  Take a look at the &quot;corporate governance&quot; ratings at Morningstar***.
        </p> Any of three would be good. T. Rowe Price, however, offers the lowest cost funds and true &quot;no loads&quot;, meaning they don&#039;t charge front end or back end loads for your account.
