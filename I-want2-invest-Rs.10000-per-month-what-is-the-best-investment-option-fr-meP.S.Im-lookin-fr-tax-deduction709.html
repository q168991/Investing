</script><p> You would only be allowed tax deductions up to Rs 1,00,000. then why invest Rs 20,000 extra. Before starting investing for returns, please ensure you are adequately insured (prefer term insurance), also have sufficient medical insurance for your self and your dependents if any. with what all amount now remains you can opt for ELSS through monthly SIP (systematic investment plan) as you require good returns in short duration, the lock in period for them is the shortest as compared to other investment options.
        </p> Mutual fund is a best option for investing money. There are so many mutual fund which gives you tax benifits. Birla tax didaction and SBI Tax didaction is best Mutual fund, mutual funds is basically two types:- <br>
 <br>
- Close Ended <br>
 <br>
- Open Ended <br>
 <br>
In Close ended a time period is open for investing or switching money. <br>
 <br>
But in open ended no time required for investing or switching money. <br>
 <br>
You are invest in money in mutual fund in one short. And second way which is very good way for investing money in mutual fund. <br>
 <br>
Open A SIP(Systematic Investment Plan) it is a very good idea for investing money in mutual fund. <br>
In this you have invest monthly basis. you are started with your price.... <br>
