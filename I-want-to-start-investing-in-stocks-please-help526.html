</script><p> In North America you must be 18 years of age to open a brokerage account.  You can have a parent open a custodian account for you using your social security number and when you turn 18 the assets in the account can be moved to an account in your name <br>
 <br>
Before you spend $0.01 on any investment, you must know what you’re doing, why you’re doing it and how to do it.  Before you invest in any security, the first investment you should make is in yourself, and the best investment you can make is by educating yourself.  <br>
 <br>
Start your education by learning why you should invest and the importance of being able to make your own decisions or how the pro’s make theirs. <br>
Here is some reading material that can get you started in the right direction,  <br>

Get into the habit of making daily visits to some websites like MSN Money and Yahoo Finance. (http://moneycentral.msn***/home.asp , http://finance.yahoo***/  <br>
 <br>
Other website that can provide instructions and help with procedures and terminology are Investopedia - http://***investopedia***/ http://***investorshub***/  <br>
Visit some of the more professional websites like Zacks Research - http://***zacks***/ Smart Money - http://***smartmoney***/ Schaeffer’s http://***schaeffersresearch***/ Some of these web sites will have advertisers who are worth looking into also. And remember, if they offer free information, get it.  Or you can meet others who are trading at http://***moneyshow***/main.asp <br>
 <br>
Attend all the free seminars you can, just be careful and don’t get pressured into anything you really don’t want or need. Most schools offer courses in finance and economics, but very few will have courses on the mechanics of the investment markets, if they do try taking the course. You may want to consider on-line courses, the New York Institute of Finance use to have such courses. Try to get some fee information from the stocks exchanges they all have (had) free booklets, SIAC and some of the regulators (FINRA SEC MSRB CBOE) may provide some free literature. <br>
 <br>
And when you think you want to invest/trade, try some paper trading to test your skills without spending you money http://simulatorinvestopedia***/ and/or  http://***tradingsimulation***/  <br>
 <br>
You at least have made the right decision to start investing, this is the first big step and it won’t be your last. Keep taking those steps forward and along the way never take the advice from people that are not in the market or try to tell you not to invest. <br>
 <br>
Good luck on your journey, study hard and you’ll invest well

</script><p> Before you start investing, you have to ask yourself if you can afford to LOSE every penny you invest. People (like the person above) will tell you to read all kinds of books and stuff which is ALL well and good! However, what they will NOT tell you is the market is a legal form of GAMBLING. It is NO different then a horse race. The difference is in WHAT you are betting ON. In a horse race, you bet on the combination of horse, jockey and the track conditions. And after a couple of minutes, you know whether you win or lose. Pure and simple, yes? In the market, when you buy stock, you are making a bet that the company will succeed and make a profit. People evaluate the company and if they feel the odds are the company will succeed, they buy stock. The more people who want to buy the higher the price. That is simply supply and demand setting the price of a stock. So, you are placing a bot on the company, the management and the product they make. That combination will win or lose, but it all is in slow motion, taking sometimes years to figure out if you are making money or losing money. You do not actually KNOW if you win until you sell your stock. Then you compare what you have now with what you started with and THAT tells you if you win or not. It you win or lose, it is called capital gains (or losses) which represents taxable income. You must be 18 to engage in commerce by law, so since you are NOT, a parent or guardian has to open the account for you, and will have to perform any transactions for you until you are 18. So, do all the other stuff the guy above suggested, just be aware that there is RISK, and that exactly like a bet at a horse race at the track, you are making a wager on the future. When it comes to making a wager, there is NO substitute for doing your homework. That is where a racing form comes in at the track, and a prospectus, among other things, in the stock market comes in. So, do your homework and KNOW the RISK, and THEN make the wager and be fully prepared to lose it all overnight... If you cannot afford to lose every penny, then you should not be in the market...
        </p> Stocks are ownership in companies. When a company needs capital for various reasons, one of the ways that it raises this money is by selling shares of itself. The shares represent peices of ownership in the company. <br>
 <br>
There is a book entitled The Intelligent Investor. It is an excellent book that would be worth reading for anyone who is interested in learning about investing. Warren Buffet has recommended this book. He is a an investor who has made billions of dollars through investing in the stock market. <br>
 <br>
The price of a stock is what someone is willing to pay for it. The question you have to ask yourself is whether it is worth purchasing at the price someone is asking for it. That is why people do research on individual companies and the economy. They are trying to determine the best price to pay for a given stock. <br>
 <br>
If you are interested in a company you want to know what the company does to earn money. Also you want to know what the company owns and what the company owes to its lenders. You also need to know how much money it makes. <br>
 <br>
You learn all of the necessary information by reading reports about the company and by paying attention to the news about the company. The most useful reports are those which the company must give to the Securities and Exchange Commission. Every company that you can buy stock for must give these reports to this governmental organization every three months. The best way to find these reports is to go to the following web site: <br>
 <br>
http://***sec.gov/edgar/searchedgar/com... <br>
 <br>
For example, if you wanted to find out information on Apple you would go to the above web site and in the place where it asks for a Ticker Symbol you would type AAPL and then press enter. After that you will see a screen that lists different documents that Apple has filed with the Securities Exchange Commission. Any document in the Filings column that is a 10-Q or 10-K would be documents you would want to read. The 10-K document is the yearly report and it has a very detailed report that gives you information about the company. You can learn a great deal about companies by reading these reports. <br>
 <br>
What you need to do is examine all the financial information. Then you have to decide if purchasing the company at its current price is a good idea. There are different ways in which people come to this conclusion. <br>
 <br>
My suggestion to you for now is to get a copy of The Intelligent Investor to read, and start reading the 10K and 10Q reports at Edgar online for companies that interest you. This will give you a great deal of information that you can use to learn about stocks.
