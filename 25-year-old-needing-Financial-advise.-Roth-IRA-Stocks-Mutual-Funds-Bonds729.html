<h1>25 year old needing Financial advise. Roth IRA? Stocks? Mutual Funds? Bonds?</h1>
<div class="answer">I know I probably shouldn&amp;#39;t be asking YA this question, but I have seen people get very good answers on here so I figured I would try.  Plus, I went to Edward Jones and basically set thru 2 hours with a Broker and left feeling like I knew less then when I walked in the door.  I am 25 years old.  I make $26,000 a year and my Employer doesn&amp;#39;t offer a 401k.  This obviously is not my career job, but it&amp;#39;s a job, and it pays my bills.  I began working when I was 16 so over this time I have been able to save up $20,000.  It is just sitting in my bank account and I am ready to invest it in something.  (Side notes:  I have no debt whatsoever.  I rent a condo.  I payed cash for my truck, and have no other bills outside of rent, electric, water, insurance, food, etc.).  After all of my bills are payed for the month I usually have about $1,000 left over.  I have heard great things about IRA&amp;#39;s(specifically ROTH IRA&amp;#39;s) and that is what I am leaning towards right now.  Is this the right move in my situation?  Or would you recommend me buying stocks?(not really what I want to do) or should I go into the mutual fund route?  Any advice would be great as I am wanting to get started sooner rather then later.  I heard if I max out my ROTH IRA every year at my age, that I can retire at 65 with atleast or near the 1 million dollar mark.  If this is true, how is it possible, and how exactly does the IRA work?  THANKS! - Bill<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> First off congrats on saving money and living within your means at a young age. There are plenty who make many times what you do and can&#039;t seem to pay their bills. <br>
 <br>
If you are looking to invest the 20k you have a Roth IRA would be a good place to start. A Roth IRA is a special type of retirement plan under US law that is generally not taxed, provided certain conditions are met.  <br>
 <br>
A Mutual fund provides simplicity and mitigated risk compared to trading stocks, but does not provide the tax benefits of an IRA. <br>
 <br>
Trading stocks has a great potential for gain, but also a great chance of loss. Trading stocks yourself is a more hands on approach that should involve careful research into ocmpanys and market trends. <br>
 <br>
Bonds are a low risk investment that also has low yields. Someone as young as you probably doesn&#039;t want much if any money in bonds. Bonds work well when you are closer to retirement and want somewhere safer to put your money. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
In the end how you diversify your portfoilo will depend on personal preference and tolerance for risk. Good luck with your investments!

</script><p> Open an Roth IRA Account with the low cost leader like Vanguard. <br>
While your are young, invest in all stock until you are close too retirement age. <br>
Pick a well diversified stock mutual fund such as the total stock market fund. <br>
It has a mixture of large, small, and international stocks. <br>
History has shown small caps to perform best, but they are very volatile.  <br>
Keep enough money in saving or money market for unexpected emergencies. <br>

        </p> Roth Ira For Dummies
        </p> Here is one thing to keep in mind about the Roth IRA account. There is never any tax on it where as there is on your 401k. This becomes important when considering your asset mix. Income producing investments are taxed at the full tax rate as will be your 401k. Hence it makes sense to invest at least some of your 401k in income producing assets--bonds, LPs, REITs. The income from each of those is taxed at the full tax rate anyway. Now since the Roth IRA is never taxed, it also makes sense to put those types of assets into the Roth IRA also. And also equity investments. What you neglected to mention are investments outside of these two vehicles. If you have some, they should be investments that would be taxed at the capital gains rate--equity investments. Actually, unless you are in the highest tax bracket it makes sense to have a portion of your equity investments outside of a 401k. By doing so your total tax bill will be decreased, especially if you are a long term investor. If you have the least hankering to invest some of your money in gold and silver those absolutely should be within a Roth IRA. Both are taxed as collectibles otherwise. Another thing to consider in regard to the 401k is that in future years the tax rate might actually be higher, perhaps much higher, than it currently is. Since you really have no choice of placing non-mutual fund investments within a 401k except for perhaps company stock, it certainly does make sense to invest Roth IRA money in company stocks rather than mutual funds. But be careful. It is very tempting for many to speculate with their Roth IRA account especially short term trading which otherwise would be taxed at the full tax rate. That would be a good way to reduce that value of the Roth account. Be just a little cautious. Invest in the likes of MCD, WMT, JNJ, BDX, KO, etc. Or maybe ETP with its 8% dividend or PAA with its 7.5% dividend. And do not invest it in fewer than 5 different companies.
        </p> ROTH IRA is a great idea. <br>
Read:  Mutual Funds For Dummies <br>
 <br>
In a ROTH you get to earn money &amp; not pay taxes on it.  Edward Jones is one of the best full service brokers (I believe the best overall)..... like all full service brokers..... they&#039;ll make tons of money on you (which in turn means.... less money for you),  Average charge is 5.75% ($575 on every $10,000 you invest.... a rip off... in my opinion. <br>
 <br>
You can invest up to $5,000 a year in an IRA (not to exceed your income). <br>
 <br>
Don&#039;t use banks or insurance companies for investment products (ever).  Right now start with a low cost, low fee Mutual Fund company.  Vanguard is the cheapest.... they&#039;re great for your grand parents &amp; perhaps your parents... but not for a 26 year old.  Once you read Mutual Funds For Dummies.... read some more (articles, Magazines, etc...).   Avoid chasing performance or recommendations by anyone.  Learn this stuff... it&#039;s not that hard &amp; will pay off for the rest of your life. <br>
 <br>
A couple of fund companies I like are; <br>
T Rowe Price <br>
Harbor Funds <br>
but there are many more to consider.
        </p> Your odds of getting good advice at Edward Jones in the retail &quot;walk in&quot; situation are nearly zero.  There are two big problems with brokers:  (a) they do not have a legal duty to put your interests ahead of their own and (b) with relatively small accounts they have a huge incentive to put you into products that generate extraordinarily high commissions.  A small account, btw, is anything less than $250,000.  Many advisors, like me, will not touch anything less than $1 million.  It is too difficult to make money without ripping people off. <br>
 <br>
With $20,000 and age 25, you have no need to get complicated or seek outside help to manage it. <br>
 <br>
I will also recommend a book:  The Lazy Person&#039;s Guide to Investing by Paul B. Farrell.  Its cheap, easy to read, and all you really need to know.  Although I like some of the other books listed here, too. <br>
 <br>
All you really need, for now, are three things: <br>
 <br>
(1) Figure out how much money you must have available for emergencies and unplanned events.  Put this money in a money market account or savings account at your local credit union or a company like Ally or INGDirect. <br>
 <br>
(2) Open an two accounts at Vanguard*** with the rest.  Put $5000 a year into a ROTH IRA account invested in the Target Retirement fund for your age group.   <br>
 <br>
(3) Put the the rest in a regular money marget mutual fund account at Vanguard invested in the Prime Money Market fund.
        </p> Congrats on being a good saver.  A Roth IRA is a great thing.  On your &quot;after tax money&quot; (no tax savings for contribution) one can save $5k/year into an account where the growth occurs without paying taxes and withdrawal one day is tax free.  It&#039;s awesome to have tax free income in retirement and it sounds like you&#039;re off to the races.  And the &#039;IRA&#039; means it&#039;s individual account so if you get married, the wife can also start one in her name for the same $ amount each year.  But yeah it&#039;s tax free growth and payout.  A great tool for retirement planning.  Good luck.
        </p> Go to a bookstore and grab yourself a book called <br>
Investing for Dummies <br>
^ not an insult - great book <br>
Spend 4 hours reading this easy book and the world will be yours <br>
It will have a chapter on different discount brokerage companies <br>
I prefer these, since EJ tends to sell high priced mutual funds <br>
They might even try to sell you some whole life insurance -  which you don&#039;t need <br>
Investment rule:  Just because you are not paranoid, does not mean they are not out to get you

There are three things you&#039;ll want to look for when picking a penny stock to make sure that you don&#039;t get penny stuck: Underlying business, financials, and footnotes. <br>
 <br>
When it comes to penny stocks, a company&#039;s underlying business is even more important than it is in exchange-traded stocks. That&#039;s because the penny stock world is home to &quot;shell&quot; companies that are legally incorporated, but don&#039;t have any business operations
