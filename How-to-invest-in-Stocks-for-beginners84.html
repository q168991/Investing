</script><p> Start with a book like _Idiot&#039;s Guide to Stock Market Investing_ to get a basic sense.  Beware--educational services and published newsletters, etc., are likely to scam you.  If you can find one person to mentor you for free or low cost then that could be a great way to go.

</script><p> Owning stock is owning a (usually very small) part of that company.  You buy stock through a broker - you pay a fee when you buy and when you sell.  There&#039;s no &quot;best stock&quot; to invest in. <br>
 <br>
A good way to start is by putting money into a mutual fund.  That pools money from many people to buy a group of stocks.   Each fund has a professional manager who chooses the stocks the fund will invest it, and each fund has a particular goal - some are higher risk  (and have higher chance of gain, but also of loss) than others, some are in particular industries.
        </p> There are 2 ways to get involved with stocks. <br>
 <br>
First is investing in stocks. Second is trading stocks. <br>
 <br>
Both of them have different perspectives when it comes to stocks. <br>
 <br>
Investors invest in a stock because they believe the company&#039;s stock price is going to rise. They make a profit by investing in the right stock. For more info: <br>

 <br>
Traders trade a stock to make a profit, and they usually are not that interested in the company that much. For more info: <br>
