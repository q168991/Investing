<h1>How to begin investing in stocks?</h1>
<div class="answer">I do not know anything about stocks...ANYTHING. However, I would like to learn more and possibly begin to buy and trade. What are books and/or articles that you would recommend? Also, any advice?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> The previous answer is a good start. Read, read and read more before investing. In addition I would set up a portfolio account in Google Finance. What you do is sign up for a gmail email account in Google. When you go to Google Finance you can start tracking stocks and building a portfolio to PRACTICE with. I would use the account to practice with so you understand what you are getting into, this will be a fast way to learn (ie hands on). This is the best approach since you can practice without risking your money. Second, stay away from options for a long long time, there is more to options than most know. <br>
 <br>
Also start reading online about what is going on in the market and try to start putting things together so you can build expectations about the future. <br>
 <br>
If you have to invest now, go for a mutual fund. You gain the advantage of diversification inexpensively and a professional manages the fund. You will also want to learn why diversification is so important. Remember the goal is to make consistent earnings, not huge returns (though it is nice) you want to beat the market when its up and lose less when it is down.   <br>
 <br>
A low cost place to trade is either Optionshouse or Tradeking, but again wait a year or two before getting into options.

</script><p> Some good books are: <br>
 <br>
&#039;Trade Your Way To Financial Freedom&#039; by Van Tharp - Despite it&#039;s cheesy title, this is the best book I have ever read on trading.  A MUST read! <br>
 <br>
&#039;Trading For A Living&#039; by Alexander Elder is also good. <br>
And &#039;Trading In The Zone&#039; by Mark Douglas is also good. <br>
 <br>
Maybe read one of the &#039;Trading For Dummies&#039;  or &#039;Investing for Dummies&#039; books first, then read the ones I&#039;ve suggested above, afterwards, as they&#039;re a bit more advanced (but are not difficult to read - they&#039;re very easy to read, but it&#039;s best if you start with the absolute basics first). <br>
 <br>
Once you&#039;ve done some studies, make sure you learn about risk management as well, as it&#039;s one thing to make profits/money, but it&#039;s another whole thing learning not to take silly risks which can &#039;blow up&#039; your account.
        </p> Learn technical analysis on charts. Stock Patterns by Barry Rudd is a good book for me.
        </p> My favorite. <br>
Investing for Dummies (not an insult - a great book) <br>
You can find this at libraries or bookstores anywhere <br>
There are chapters on different brokerages and what their fees and minums are. <br>
Chapters on what mutual funds, etfs, stocks, etc are
        </p> by going to college studying finance majors, there are so many knowledge and connections you need to know before investing in stocks!
        </p> Check ehow***
        </p> watch mad money on cnbc stocks that are doing really good are amazon (amzn) and arch coal (aci).
