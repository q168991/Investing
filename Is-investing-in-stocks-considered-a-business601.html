<h1>Is investing in stocks considered a business?</h1>
<div class="answer">I&amp;#39;m applying for a government agency&amp;#39;s program which helps graduating students to put up their business after graduation. I can&amp;#39;t think of any business applicable to me. I can&amp;#39;t cook so well. I can&amp;#39;t do wedding, birthday invitation cards.
I just thought of investing in stocks and managing it properly afterward. I just research - read newspapers, surf the net and everything.
Do you think the agency will approve my application?
Are there any alternatives/suggestions for a small business that can be put up worth 50, 000 pesos only?
Thank you.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Investing in stocks can be considered a business. Some will point out the benefit of doing it under an entity such as a C corp. Expect to take about 4 years to learn to do it profitably. <br>
 <br>
 Even though you can&#039;t cook its pretty easy to learn basic cooking. A taco stand or hot dog stand should be easy enough to run. <br>
 <br>
Good luck
