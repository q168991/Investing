</script><p> which stocks is a personal preference. well established companies with high market capitalization will usually be safer investments (for example, coca-cola or apple) and small companies with low market cap are usually more risky. stocks trading under 5$ per share are often referred to as penny stocks and are usually avoided by novice investors due to their volatility and risk. <br>
 <br>
long term vs short term really depends on your situation. <br>
for example, a person planning on buying a house would often need cash to make a down payment on a mortgage, they would go for short term investments. <br>
someone that already has a house might go for some more long term stuff. <br>
 <br>
as for what price, you have to sell at a higher price than the price you paid in order to make a profit (don&#039;t forget to take into account the brokerage fees for the buy and the sell transactions!) <br>
 <br>
if your stock is tanking and you want to cut your losses you may end up selling at a lower price, but unfortunately sometimes that is the best decision. <br>
 <br>
good luck

</script><p> I would purchase as many shares of BPT as I could get with the 10 grand. It pays better than average dividends, it is invested in oil transportation, not drilling, etc. I think oil prices will be on the steady rise the next few years since there is only a finite amount available and demand is soaring in  developing countries. There will be price swings in the market, but I consider this one a long term hold. It is currently at +- $90. I would consider selling at $110. Like all stocks(BPcomes to mind) this could have ups and downs, buts that life.
