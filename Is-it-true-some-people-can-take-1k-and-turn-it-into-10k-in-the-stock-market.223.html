</script><p> Absolutely. The question really is, how quickly can someone do it. <br>
 <br>
The key is always time vs risk. If you buy a risky stock with a high return and it performes well, you&#039;ll build your stock very quickly. <br>
 <br>
If the stock is not risky with a lower return, it will grow more slowly. However, you have a lesser chance of losing it all. More volitile stocks offer larger returns because otherwise who would want to invest in it!? <br>
 <br>
I have a stock for natural resources that grew 28% this year. Based on the 1K investment you mentioned, that would equate to $1,280 now. I think it&#039;s unrelalistic to find a stock that will do that well EACH year but that&#039;s why mutual funds are so attractive - you buy shares of lots of stocks so you don&#039;t swing so much with losses or gains.  <br>
 <br>
So yes, it is possible if you find the right stock. I think it&#039;s unlikely you&#039;d find one with a 1000% return in a year though.

</script><p> Sure. However, it involves risk. A company that might do that is either very new, or more commonly be on the verge of bankruptcy where there is a chance you might lose everything.  <br>
 <br>
A good example is the independent power producers, like AES or Mirant. AES was about $1.25 about 4 years ago and now is about $22. Apple was about $8, 4 years ago and is now about $132.   <br>
 <br>
The best way, is perhaps if you have $20K and invest $19 K into safer stocks or mutual funds, and invest that $1K in the risky stock. However if $1K is all you have, you might not want to risk it . Another strategy is to put $15K in safer stocks and put $5K in 5 companies who are risky. If 4 companies go bust, and one turns into $10K, they you are still up $5K.
        </p> Don&#039;t mix investing and speculation.  <br>
 <br>
You&#039;re talking about speculation (short term) here. Such a deal is possible, of course. To the condition you&#039;ve got some insight information that will lead to a major market move once public.  <br>
 <br>
But those information are considered illegal, even if it happens now and then.  <br>
 <br>
One thing is for sure, if you get your information from the newspaper, it is already outdated !
        </p> one of my friend did it once. to tell you the truth, it is as difficult and ridiculous as you might think. it can be done with 20% growth in 13 years time. what matter is how you mitigate the risk. <br>
 <br>
in stock, same as in business, 90% of them loose money. if you serious about investing in stock market, try to focus on capital preseverance. or avoid to be included in the 90% statistic! <br>
 <br>
i myself invest for long-term. to date my stock performed 20 to 25% p.a in avg for the past 3 years. with the same performance (forecast from historical performances) i will get 10k from my initial 1k in ten years time. <br>
 <br>
i simplified and formulated my method into step-by-step winning formula here: <br>
http://***stock-investment-made-easy.co... <br>
try this and find out yourself which stocks can make you 10k with only 1k!!
        </p> Yes it can be done but you will need to know a lot about  the stock market
        </p> Yes, but it&#039;s a lot easier and more common to take 100K and turn it into 10K.
        </p> Yes it can be done.
        </p> yes it can happen but 99% of the time...you LOSE
