<h1>Stock Trading Questions?</h1>
<div class="answer">Right I&amp;#39;ve got a couple of questions before I pursue trading stocks which I require answers too before I progress any further. 

The first question being is there a &amp;#39;limit&amp;#39; to the amount of money needed to start off? By that a mean a minimum limit? Currently being a student money is tight so I haven&amp;#39;t got too much to begin with, so I was wondering if £100 (round about) would be enough to make a start?

Second question is there a minimum age limit to begin stock trading? As stupid as that sounds, being under 18 seems to restrict a lot, therefore I was wondering if trading too was one of these restrictions?

Finally, is online trading reccomended? I can&amp;#39;t really afford a broker, so I was wondering peoples opinions?

Thanks.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Traditionally, brokerages would require a minimum balance to open a brokerage account, that minimum balance used to be around $2,000 (probably around £1,500) but competition in the market place has the minimum amount dropping and you may find some small operations that will allow you to open an account with less.    The minimum balance is more that you&#039;re more likely to be successful trading if you start off with a larger balance then with a smaller one.   People who just open with £100 will likely lose their money or become disenchanted with their inability to capitalize on opportunities.   Of course a regular cash flow is worth a lot more than a lump sum, if you can afford £100 out of each paycheck then that&#039;s something but £100 by itself is hardly worth anything at all. <br>
 <br>
The age requirement is more a matter of when you can be legally held responsible in a binding contract.   You can invest at an age younger than 18 but an adult would have to sign off on a custodial account and take the responsibility for your actions. <br>

Online trading is with a broker.   You&#039;re just communicating with the broker via the Internet rather than over a phone or in person.   There is no such thing as trading direct over the Internet.   The stocks are traded in public exchanges to which brokerage firms have memberships or seats and they funnel their customers orders through the floor traders who use the seats to gain access to the trade floor.   Of course it&#039;s mostly computerized now and may not actually involve an actual floor trader on the trade floor but in order for you to bypass a broker and trade on the exchanges directly, you would have to buy a seat on the exchange which could cost you millions.   You can&#039;t afford to not use a broker.   Of course, some of the low cost online only brokers can offer you very low commissions but keep in mind that such brokers may only have one seat on an obscure exchange and may have very little in inventory.   You&#039;re better off with the big box discount brokers like Fidelity, Vanguard and Scwhabs because they have large inventories and many seats on several exchanges.

</script><p> You have to think about what your goals are. Are you trying to make a quick buck or are you in it for the long term. There is a difference between being a trader and an investor. To be an investor you don&#039;t need a lot of money at all to start. If you plan on making money day or swing trading then you will need a lot more money up front. I currently use Share builder from ING.  I am a long term investor and I chose stocks that pay high dividends. Keep in mind that there are commissions that must be paid, and any earnings you make dividends or capital gains need to be reported for tax purposes. Not sure on the age question.
        </p> Please do yourself a huge favor and postpone trading or investing until you are older and have acquired enough money to afford the risks.  I know trading looks easy but most who try to make a quick buck in the market, instead lose their money.  What does make sense is making regular purchases of a good mutual fund.  Buy every month, whether the market is rising or falling and when you are middle aged you will have a lot of money.  I understand that young people want everything right now and have little patience,  but impetuous short term trading only happens to work when the whole market is rising dramatically like the recent doubling from the recession lows.  Now, with the market much more expensive and earnings growth likely to slow, the market is a volatile dangerous place for the inexperienced.  Please take this advice from a veteran stock investor as I promise you will not be happy when you experience losses.
        </p> instead of buying products of your favorite brand, buy shares of them, and make money with them :D You can easily save up anywhere from $5-10 a week, and have compound interest work its magic. Once you save enough to reach the minimum need to open a brokerage account with someone like TDAmeritrade, then you can get started on picking your chips and hedge from there.  <br>
 <br>
I dont know what the other people are taking about, but you can do anything aslong as you put your energy and focus into it. Educate yourself on the principles, theories, views, and the difference between Bulls and Bears. Then start building from there.
        </p> The last thing you need right now is a brokerage firm Before you invest in any security, the first investment you should make is in yourself, and the best investment you can make is by educating yourself. Had you spent time educating yourself you would know exactly what broker to use.
