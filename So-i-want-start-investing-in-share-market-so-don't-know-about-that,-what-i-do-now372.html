</script><p> The stock market where you buy shares of stock at a price and sell it at a higher price for profit. You will need $2,500 to 3,500 to open an account with a discount broker to trade shares of stock.  Or you can do the same with mutual funds where you open an account with a mutual fund family. Minimums to open an account with both fund families and brokers vary. If you want to practice, some brokers have practice accounts called papertrade or virtual accounts that simulate real trading with monopoly money. <br>
 <br>
You have to determine the parameters to get into a stock and out of the stock you purchased to make money. It is the investing/trading strategy that is the key. You can paper trade a strategy until it proves to be worthwhile using. Things to consider in selecting stocks is using just the fundamentals of the company or just the technicals of the stock or both. You can scan to meet certain fundamentals of the company and then use it technicals to buy at support and sell at resistance or hold until the trend changes. You can also look at a sector that is rising and pick the best stock in that sector based on fundamentals as well as price action.  <br>
 <br>
first check with your broker to see if they have any educational resources. Then sign up free and check out moneyshow*** and search for cybertradinguniversity, pristine, and velez, etc. to view the free videos from those trading schools to see which ones match your trading style.

</script><p> If you really want to begin investing your money, try to learn some basics about it. The secrete here is that there are no secretes.  In order to raise your money you have to be careful and now what you are doing or your going to lose your money as I did.  I can give you some tips:  0) Save as much as you can.  Don&#039;t start with less than 1000.  If you invest less than that with the broker&#039;s commissions you have little chances to make profits. 1) Learn how to open an account with a on-line broker (choose the ones with lower commission). 2) Don&#039;t trust any magic programs, If you are really serious about this. 3) Learn something about fundamental analysis. 4) Learn something about technical analysis (how to read charts). 5) When you think you are ready, try to find some candidates to invest in and use simulators like the investopedia stock simulator before you invest real money. 6) Keep learning.  <br>
If you have enough money you can pay for a mentor program that could accelerate your learning.
        </p> Are you able to invest in the global share market, or only in the Indian market? Start by going to the library and borrowing a basic book on stockmarket investing, such as one of the &quot;Idiot&#039;s ..&quot; or &quot;Dummies ...&quot; series of books. When you understand how the market works and know how to pick stocks based on fundamentals or technical analysis, then go to the financial section of newspapers and make your choice. Investing in the stock market is not a shortcut to wealth. Investing involves risk. The shares you buy can go up or down. Do not invest money you cannot afford to lose.
        </p> So you say you want to learn how to invest in the stock market. <br>
 <br>
Education is the key ingredient. Read all you can get your hands on about investing and the stock market. Knowledge is power, so become an educated invest before making your first buy. <br>

Your next task is to figure out 4 things. <br>
 <br>
The amount of risk you’re willing to take? <br>
No risk, Low risk, Medium risk <br>
You get the picture. <br>
 <br>
What kind of investor do you want to be? <br>
Saver, Speculator or Specialist <br>
 <br>

Day trader, Short term, Long term or Life long <br>
 <br>
What do you want to invest in? <br>
Stocks, Bonds, Coins, Precious metals, Money Market, Real Estate,Etc. <br>
 <br>
There are different styles of investing so learn them all and then pick the one    that suits your risk tolerance and tastes. <br>
 <br>
 I chose to be a Dividend Investor. I do reinvest my dividends and that buys me more stock. Since I’m in it for a life time I do not let the roller coaster ride of the stock market influence my decision to sell. I have set up an excel spread sheet of stocks that I have considered to buy and loaded them on to a portfolio on yahoo finance. When I copy and paste the current prices into spread sheet my excel spread sheet tell me when to buy, hold, or sell. It does this by the criteria that I set up in the formulas I created in my spread sheet. I research all the companies before they go my spread sheet.
        </p> Start reading - in print or online. <br>
 <br>
Useful newspapers: Economic Times , Business Standard, Business Line, Financial Express <br>
 <br>
Periodicals :Capital Market, Business Today, Business Today etc <br>
 <br>
Web materials:  <br>
***bseindia***, ***nseindia*** are the most authentic share related websites run by both the stock markets. <br>
 <br>
***icicidirect*** runs beautiful and very exhaustive section &quot;Research&quot;, few beautifully explained concept sections under &quot;customer service&quot; like basics of trading and investing. <br>
 <br>
***moneycontrol*** <br>
 <br>
Please stay away from many websites who give &quot;tips&quot; on trading and investments. Usually this will not help you learn anything.
        </p> Well i can tell you the best to invest. I do not know you, but i looked into the same thing and i found Nik Halik and he got a program that is called the Sharelord. Now if you are really interested then please take the time to go to his website and read upon him on google. there is not one bad comment of him. I personally invested in the lecture and program and especially if your new to this. I tried many other once before and you will be doomed because your new. With him you got the best chance ever. I hope this helped. <br>

        </p> For a person with no knowledge on share market , it makes sense to start with MUTUAL FUNDS. <br>
 <br>
Visit ***valuereseaarchonline*** to understand mutual funds. <br>
 <br>
Invest via SIP in the top rated funds , preferably large cap &amp; balanced funds. <br>
 <br>
Avoid NFOs &amp; SECTOR FUNDS. <br>
 <br>
Later on you can divert part of your investment into DIRECT EQUITY.  <br>
 <br>
You will have to open a demat a/c &amp; register with a share broker for this.
        </p> Learning is the way to go. Check out educative articles on http://***winfromus*** or ask them what you want to know. You will find many stock market basic education original articles there.
