<h1>Small business stock investing?</h1>
<div class="answer">Hello all. I have a small business that I am thinking about using some of my capital to invest in stocks. I have a few questions:

1. Is it a good idea to invest some of my capital in stocks?

2. Could I use brokerages such as E-Trade and ShareBuilder to invest from my small business? If so, would I set up the account as a business account, joint account, individual account?

3. If I was able to earn money from the stocks under my small business, how would the taxes work? Would they tax my business or tax me personally? 

Thanks and look forward to great answers!!<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Investing in stocks isn&#039;t a bad idea but you should diversify with other investments as well.  You could use E-trade and other sites but I dint see what the benefit would be for you.  If you are self employed and make a profit through your business won&#039;t you have to pay social security and medicare on it as well as the other taxes?  It will be a tax negative.  I don&#039;t see any benefit from doing this unless you do it through a SEP IRA then it is definitely a good idea. You can invest up up to 25% of your income up to $49000 and not pay taxes on the business income you invest in the account.  You will pay taxes on it though when you take the money out in retirement as income. Look up SEP IRAs and talk to your accountant. They are set up to help out people that have their own businesses.
