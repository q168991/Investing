</script><p> Finding the best stocks to invest is not easy but it is not impossible either. With a little patience and right technique anyone can make out which stock will give him good return in the future. For that you need to adopt a few techniques that we will discuss in this article. <br>
 <br>
Information is the key in stock market trading and thanks to the Internet, finding information is not so hard now. There are hundreds of websites that offer detailed stock market news, tips and industry info. But following all these websites is not only impossible but also confusing as you will find that most of these websites contradict themselves. So it is better to select a few websites and follow them closely and keep track which one gives the authentic information. Once you have found out one or two such sources for reliable information bank on them for determining your stock market strategies. <br>
 <br>
Have a plan for stock trade and do not jump over everything that comes on your way. Focus on a specific area or industry and keep your investments concentrated in that particular area. In that way you will be able to keep comprehensive information on the stocks and that particular area of the market. It will be easier for you to closely monitor the individual stocks and the companies that will definitely help you to make wise investments. Remember if you invest in what you know thoroughly then it will most likely give you good return. <br>
 <br>
While trading stocks always distribute your investment wise. Instead of investing in one particular stock select a few good stocks to invest. It is always better to put your money in different stocks as stock market is extremely volatile and even the biggest blue chip companies have down falls at the stock market. So, by investing in number of selected stocks at a point of time you will significantly lower the risk. <br>
 <br>
There are so many experts these days offering tips that will make you rich with just one or two investments. Surely, it can happen to someone, but there is no surefire technique to predict which stock will give you multiple returns. So it is always better to do your own research for selecting the stocks to invest. There are so many things that you need to consider before investing in a particular stock. Study the current price of the stock and compare it with the P/E ratio and that will give you a fair idea if the stock is over priced or not. Take a look at the sales margin and volume of the stock to see the future of the company and how the market is reacting for the stock. Taking all these factors into consideration make your investment strategy and always have a plan for investing instead of going by the buzz in the market. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
So, educate yourself, clear all your doubts and then invest your hard earned money in stocks. Those who are successful in the stock market are those who always take things positively. Therefore, whether you are a new or an experienced trader - you need to have that positive attitude towards the volatile market. Moreover, if you have done all the ground works before trading stocks - you are bound to make substantial profits from your trading. So, invest your money and enjoy your life in a better way without thinking about financial constraints. <br>

</script><p> Well, first you want to pay off any credit card debts &amp; keep 3-6 mos savings in a mm acct for emergencies or job loss.  And you want to be able to cope with minor whims of life like car repair, co-payment of medical care if you have insurance, &amp; other stuff that invariably shows up.  Then, too, you may want to save for a vacation, a washer &amp; dryer, or even a house payment without risking that money.  To have any money left at all for investment, you just about have to take it out first &amp; put it into a tax-deferred retirement acct, but then, maybe you already know all that.  The fact that you&#039;re even asking shows that you must know a bit already.  So from there... <br>
 <br>
I think the rule of thumb is 100 - your age = 100 -20 = 80% in stocks.  That means the market would have time to recover before you retire.  Other people have other opinions.  Bob Brinker on the radio says to go 50-50, that is, 50% stock funds &amp; 50% fixed assets (bonds, CD&#039;s, a Ginnie Mae fund, etc. when you retire, regardless of age.  But then, you just want to know about now, and he&#039;s much more heavily weighted in stocks for the younger folks like you.  In fact, I think he&#039;d say to put it all into stocks after you&#039;ve set aside for everyday savings &amp; emergencies.  He also says to choose mostly mutual funds for the stocks and 40-50% of those in index mutual funds.  For individual stocks, he recommends no more than 5% of your stocks in any one company.    <br>
 <br>
It&#039;s good to avoid sector funds, such as technology funds, &amp; many of us found out why during the crash of the tech stocks around the yr 20000.  Also, there are various opinions on what percent should be in international funds.  These recommendations range from 10% to 20%.  We can see why this year.  After several yrs of spectacular gains, they&#039;ve really tanked this year, &amp; we&#039;re hoping for a good come-back.  So you see, it&#039;s not just a matter of what % should be in stocks.  There&#039;s a little bit more to it than than, but not too complicated once you start tuning into learning about it.   <br>
 <br>
For more info, see Bob Brinker&#039;s website or Clark Howard&#039;s website or listen to their radio programs.  Also see books by Jonathan Clements (recently retired from writing a financial column for the NY Times) and other books for the layperson.  Try books in the public library.  Try before you buy.  What you&#039;re looking for are authors/speakers who have a &quot;get rich slowly&quot; philosophy &amp; want you to keep costs down by buying no-load mutual funds &amp; keep risk down. <br>
 <br>
These guys usually recommend Vanguard, Fidelity, or Charles Schwab for low expense mutual funds, but certainly you may find others that you like.  Maybe you already have funds or individual stocks. <br>
 <br>
Then, too, you can google &quot;Modern Portfolio Theory&quot; on keeping a balanced portfolio, &amp; you can look at the annual index for Morningstar every January in your public library, as well as ratings and comments that Morningstar makes.       <br>
