</script><p> there&#039;s about 100,000 stocks currently available, <br>
 <br>
Before any one jumps in and tries to buy stock, they must first decide if they are going to be a trader or an investor. (A trader is very short term holder of a stock – 1 minute to 3 months, an investor is a 6 months and beyond holder).  <br>
 <br>
Decide on how much capital you have available for investing/trading and how much of that are in going to spend. (You should never spend 10% of you investing/trading capital on a particular stock. Decide what industry in want. Look for good trades/investments in that industry and move with caution <br>
 <br>
Before you invest in any security, the first investment you should make is in yourself, and the best investment you can make is by educating yourself.  <br>
 <br>
Start your education by learning why you should invest and the importance of being able to make your own decisions or how the pro’s make theirs. <br>
 <br>
Here is some reading material that can get you started in the right direction,  <br>
The first book you should read is Rich Dad Poor Dad by Robert Kiyosaki <br>
Then try some of these <br>
What Works on Wall Street by James O&#039;Shaunessey <br>
Beating the Street by Peter Lynch <br>
One Up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch <br>

Get into the habit of making daily visits to some websites like MSN Money and Yahoo Finance.  (http://moneycentral.msn***/home.asp http://finance.yahoo***/ ) <br>
 <br>
While at MSN following the strategy lab analysts to get a feel for what the pros are doing and why.  This site has some basic information for beginners. If any site offers free information, take it. <br>
 <br>
Other website that can provide instructions and help with procedures and terminology are  <br>
Investopedia - http://***investopedia***/  Stock Charts - http://stockcharts***/ <br>
http://***investorshub***/  http://***1source4stocks***/ <br>
  <br>
Visit some of the more professional websites like Zacks - http://***zacks***/  <br>
Smart Money - http://***smartmoney***/  Schaeffer’s – http://***schaeffersresearch***/ <br>
Some of these web sites will have advertisers who are worth looking into also.  And remember, if they offer free information, get it.

</script><p> Well, my favorite place for finding information on stock is Google Finance (finance.google***).  Yahoo! Finance is also pretty good, and gives different information than Google... <br>
 <br>
Now, once you have a site that shows you ALL the stocks that are available, you&#039;ll need to figure out what to look for. <br>
 <br>
NOT ALL STOCKS ARE WORTH INVESTING IN! <br>
 <br>
In fact, very few publicly traded companies are worth investing in at any point in time if you start weighing in their current price compared to their intrisinic value, etc. <br>
 <br>
Now, I&#039;m an advocate of value investing (finding great companies, buying these companies at a discount, and only selling once the company becomes overvalued...).  Having a disciplined investment strategy that you follow is just as important (if not more important) than finding a place where all the stocks are listed... <br>
 <br>
Hope this helps, and good luck!
        </p> Why not start by learning about investing. By this I mean, you need to form a plan and objectives, set your risk tolerance in order to determine which stocks or mutual funds you should even consider. After doing this, you will have a much small and more manageble list to work from, then you can determine which of those is the best for you. Try the site below to learn about investing without having to read through a bunch of technical jargon you may not undestand. Good luck.
        </p> Yahoo Finance - type in the name of the company you are wondering (to see if they are publicly traded) and it will show you their info. <br>
 <br>
I don&#039;t know of any site that just has a full list of ALL stocks - there are wayyyyyyyyyyy too many out there
        </p> Yahoo! Finance is a great place to look at stocks. Go to stocks, type in the ticker symbol or look by category and choose a buisness. You can view the current price, graphs, and all that fundecational stuff!!!
        </p> There are various stock screeners on the net.  You can go directly to the exchange websites to see an entire list.
        </p> There aren&#039;t any stocks that aren&#039;t &quot;available&quot;. If it is a publicly traded company then it is available. It is all always on the market...It isn&#039;t exactly like they just sell it all one day and there isn&#039;t any more left.
        </p> well go to http://pisco2.tk  than go to investment column last year i invested 2000$ and i made made 50000$ from share and Saving ACcount that site will Give you complete tutrial about investment
        </p> try yahoo or MSN... under finance...
