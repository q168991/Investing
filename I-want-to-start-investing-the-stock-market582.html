</script><p> I&#039;m a professional trader and first let me say I appreciate your service so I can trade in the markets everyday. Thank you. <br>
 <br>
Don&#039;t worry about the amount you start with. It&#039;s all about what you do with that. I started trading when I was a teenager with $1500 and now I&#039;m a full-time trader five years later. <br>
 <br>
The biggest thing you need to understand before you just jump into the markets is that if you view investing as gambling then you&#039;re destined to lose the money you trade. <br>
 <br>
I can&#039;t emphasize enough that you need to learn about the markets BEFORE you get into trading anything. Education is the difference between those who make it and those who don&#039;t. <br>
 <br>
Let me recommend three of my favorite trading books to give you a great start: &quot;Mastering the Trade&quot; by John Carter, &quot;Japanese Candlestick Charting Techniques&quot; by Steve Nison, and &quot;How to Make Money in Stocks&quot; by William O&#039;Neill. Also I would suggest you pick up a copy of &quot;The Automatic Millionaire&quot; by David Bach to give you a money mindset you&#039;ll need to trade and think about how to manage debt and finances. <br>
 <br>
Learn technical analysis. There&#039;s no more important aspect to anything you trade. It&#039;s what I live on and the books I recommended to you will give you a great background. <br>
 <br>
Even if you trade in a retirement account with mutual funds, learn technicals and your money has a much better chance of growing. <br>
 <br>
I really believe the road to riches is paved with small transactions. Your $500 and adding to it can become a large amount in 10 years with the right trading discipline. <br>
 <br>
If I can trade the markets, you can too. Educate yourself before committing capital. Good luck, hopefully this helped. <br>
 <br>

</script><p> Investing in the stock market is a great way to make money online. however, if you don&#039;t know what you are doing, you can lose more than you earn. Before you start, learn some stock market basics, like selecting the right stock to trade, timing your entry and exits from trades, and risk management.
        </p> Your first option, should be to open a retirement account. This is always a good investment, regardless <br>
of who you are.  <br>
 <br>
If you have fully funded your retirement account and would like other options, you should consider a DRIP Plan.  <br>
 <br>
They are seldom recommended by brokers due to the low rate of commissions received. However, these  <br>
reinvestment plans can be very powerful long-term investments. Studies have shown that DRIP&#039;s are one of <br>
the best strategies on Wall Street.  <br>
 <br>
They are inexpensive and easy to start. New investors to the stock market should definitely consider a DRIP Plan. <br>
 <br>
Companies like Toyota, Royal Canadian Bank, Sony, Bank of America, General Electric and many other Blue Chip <br>
Stocks can be purchased through your DRIP Plan, with as little as 1 share in most cases.  <br>
 <br>
These long-term plans are great for beginners as well as veterans. Check them out.  <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Best of Luck
        </p> This amount of money is going to make it hard to invest in stocks. The fees are going to wipe out your monthly contributions. With this amount of money, I would start to look into alternative investments. I do some P2P lending that yields me around 14%. At this rate, you can double your money in 5 years, and that isn&#039;t including your monthly contributions. Once you retire, you will have a pension from the military. Then, you will probably have enough to jump into the stock market. Here is an article about P2P lending to help get you started, http://***thefinancialfitnessclub***/a... .
        </p> Every time you buy or sell a stock you pay about $20 or $30 on brokerage, so if you invest $30 a month then deducting this brokerage fee you aren&#039;t going to have enough to buy or sell anything. <br>
 <br>
I recommend you instead open up a mutual fund. There are many mutual fund managers. The biggest in America is Fidelity and the second-biggest is Vanguard. You usually need about $2000 or so to open up a fund. Once you do this, however, mutual funds allow you to invest bit-by-bit with zero fees every time you contribute. However, every year you must pay about 0.3% of the fund&#039;s total value in management fees.
        </p> the best thing to do for someone that doesn&#039;t know their way around the stock market is to find investors like Fidelity or amerifest. I use amerifest and like it a lot. they will take your money and invest it for you, for a small fee of course.
        </p> You should really have $1500 or more for your portfolio in order to be able to buy enough stocks in multiple sectors to have a diversified portfolio.
