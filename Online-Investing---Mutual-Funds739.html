<h1>Online Investing - Mutual Funds?</h1>
<div class="answer">I was thinking about putting about $5,000-$10,000 in a mutual fund with an online investor. Does anybody have any advice? Best? Worst? Why? Minimum amount?
Any info would be great. Right now it&amp;#39;s all sitting in a CD, which is about to mature, and was looking for a higher return investment. I am aware that it&amp;#39;s a higher risk.

</script><p> A diversified fund would be Vanguard&#039;s Star fund VGSTX.  It is a balanced fund, with 65% stocks, and 35% bonds.  A more aggressive fund, would be Vanguard&#039;s Total Market Index VTSMX.  It is 100% stocks.  I would probably open an account with Vanguard.  But Fidelity, and TRowe Price also have excellent funds.
        </p> I use eTrade for all my stuff. My employer also has emplyees use it for out ESPP so I personally like that option.
