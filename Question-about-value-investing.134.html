<h1>Question about value investing.?</h1>
<div class="answer">i am reading a book called Value Investing from graham to buffett and beyond.

is it a good book?

where do i go from here? i want to try hands on things like analyzing FS, but i do not exactly know what im doing is right, for example appraising current assets and so on, evaluating macroeconomic drivers.

it all seems so ambiguous. like too many subjectiveness. in day trading, i am completely mechanical. in analyzing stocks for investing, i find there are no strict borders, and the effort may not pay off at least after a year or two, or even longer.

one key worry i have is, how do i accurately determine the intrinsic value when thers so much subjectivity to this process. once i have a good measure of intrinsic value, where to go from there? experienced investors must feel some level of confidence about their analysis, i currently do not feel it.

thank you.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Here&#039;s probably a different look on value. <br>
 <br>
Value has a different meaning for different people who are involved in the &quot;food chain&quot; of value. When a company first talks about an IPO the company people have an idea of how much money they want to raise, they&#039;ve got an idea of their business, growth, etc. Then the Wall Street people get involved and each of them has their own idea and each of them wants their piece of the pie for contributing their ideas. Then they have to package it together and get the underwriters and banks involved. Everyone gets their piece of the pie. By the time it gets around to the public, the idea of &quot;value&quot; is different than from when it started. (Probably &quot;overvalued.&quot;)  <br>
 <br>
Here&#039;s an analogy. Let&#039;s say there&#039;s a factory that makes paper clips. The company knows where to buy the metal, maybe they mine it and smelt it. So they&#039;ve got some costs there. They&#039;ve got the operating costs of the factory, employee salaries, etc. They make a whole bunch of paperclips which they sell to their network of wholesalers. Once its in the wholesaler&#039;s hands the factory has their profit. They basically have turned a raw material into a product and charged for it. Now the wholesalers have their network of retailers they can sell to. So their profit comes from their means of distribution and storage as well as having a bunch of contacts in their Rolodex. The retailers have their local neighborhood of stores and they mark up the price to sell it to the public.  <br>
 <br>
Now if you walk into the store and buy a bunch of paperclips can you resell them for a profit. No. Because someone else can just walk into the same store and buy them for the same price. <br>
 <br>
So the public, at the bottom of the &quot;food chain&quot;, is looking at something that already has all the value built into the paper clip. No more value can be put in there. <br>
 <br>
Same thing with stocks. <br>
 <br>
As you can tell, I don&#039;t believe in value investing, unless you&#039;re working at the source of the food chain.

        </p> to no longer be too technical, cost making an investment is basically the act of paying for for a company that&#039;s undervalued (or possibly paying for and advertising at a chit) given the present cost it trades at. there are a form of simple strategies to become conscious of a company that&#039;s presently undervalued by utilising the conventional public markets. here is an occasion of one of Warren Buffet&#039;s investments. in case you do no longer understand who he&#039;s, he&#039;s probably going one among the final cost investors ever and is probably going one among the right 10 wealthiest human beings. He invested in Coke by way of fact he observed that the Coke kind became into quite nicely worth extra desirable than it became into getting credit for, that it wasn&#039;t being precise contemplated interior the perceived cost of the corporate (which became into the present inventory cost). He felt the corporate deserved to be valued extra surprisingly and he invested in it. for constructive, he became into ideal and made a especially penny from his investment. The concepts around cost making an investment could be utilized in any of your investments. purchase a inventory whilst it quite is undervalued/low-fee to the place it would be worth. by utilising paying for whilst its low-fee, you narrow back your draw back danger, and strengthen the upside. in case you opt for to verify the bible to cost making an investment, examine the &quot;clever Investor&quot; by utilising Ben Graham (the guy that taught Mr. Buffet the thank you to take a place). you will might desire to absolutely understand the simple concepts of making an investment first nevertheless, so start up with a beginner/intro to making an investment e book.
