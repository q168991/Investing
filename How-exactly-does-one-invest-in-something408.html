</script><p> In order to buy stock in a public company you need a brokerage account.  You can open up an account with a local full service broker, or you can open up an account with a discount internet broker such as etrade, tradeking, scottrade, etc. <br>
 <br>
A full service broker may provide you with stock suggestions or other advice.  A full service broker can also place trade orders for you.  With an online broker you will most likely not get any advice and will have to orders yourself.  Internet brokers are really convenient though, and are typically much cheaper. <br>
 <br>
To get started simply look in a phone book or visit an online broker&#039;s website.  Someone will be glad to help you.

</script><p> Buying stock is easy as you just need to open an account with an online stock broker and deposit some cash. <br>
 <br>
Making money out of stocks is much harder and most beginners lose money so try practice trading first as that will give you a chance to learn how it all works before rising any real money.
        </p> find a stock broker. u may find one in the yellow pages or usually in downtown if you ask around people usually know.
