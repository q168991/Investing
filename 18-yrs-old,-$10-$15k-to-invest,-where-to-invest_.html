<h1>18 yrs old, $10-$15k to invest, where to invest?</h1>
<div class="answer">Hi,

I&amp;#39;m currently 18 years old with $10-$15k to invest. I want to set aside $5k for my startup businesses, so I have about $10k ready to be spent. What are my investment options? I want high, residual income (at least over $500/month). The lower the risk, the better.

Ideas?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> I&#039;m a 17 year old in a very similar situation and I&#039;m looking to invest.  It just so happens that I&#039;ve spend the last couple days reading business week, on company websites, forbes, fool***, and google finance so it is all fresh in my mind.   <br>
 <br>
Unfortunately, this year isn&#039;t going to be the greatest for investment but if you do your research you can find some good picks.  That kind of return with little risk is what EVERYONE wants but few get.  Make sure you do your research before buying anything.   <br>
 <br>
I recommend the technology sector and companies with a good international presence.  Tech companies are supposed to soar this year, and keep it international because the U.S. economy is not gonna be that good this year... Growth outside the U.S. will be far superior to internal growth.  Look at health care companies and other industries that don&#039;t get influenced by the economy... consumer products GENERALLY won&#039;t do as well this year.  And stay away from the housing market.   <br>
 <br>
Good luck!  Make sure you look at a company&#039;s information thoroughly before buying stock in it.

</script><p> I think some mutual funds will let you invest with as little as 50$ / month (with automatic deposit) but may require you to put down several thousand dollars up front. As for which mutual fund, there are a bunch but a number of them (like Fidelity) have funds that automatically spread your investment into the right blend of investment categories based on when you want to retire which means you don&#039;t have to worry about how to invest your money ... Probably a good start for you until you can talk to more people and learn more about retirement investing.
        </p> Penny stocks don’t cost much money and promise big profits. But trading penny stocks is also a good way to lose money. <br>
 <br>
Sure, it’s possible to profit when you understand the game. Learn here https://tr.im/abIxp <br>

For investors who can’t afford shares of Google or Apple, the potential gains from trades like this are too good to pass up. So penny-stock trading thrives. With a relatively small investment you can make a nice return if the trade works out.
        </p> to the kid with 10+15 k, mutual funds, i&#039;ve lost little with them and it&#039;s been about 5 yrs.i&#039;m still ahead of original investment and if a cash out will have made about 15 times original investment.
        </p> Invest in a book about investing. You&#039;ll be far better off than asking for financial advise from random strangers.
        </p> You need to invest some time in learning a thing or two.
        </p> Ummm - do you mean $500/month income from your business?  Because if you are 18, and you are investing $10,000, you shouldn&#039;t even be thinking of income off of it. You should be in an aggressive mutual fund and be reinvesting the dividends for 40 years or so.  I can provide the names of several good mutual funds.
        </p> Ready to invest,  you need to start slowly you are getting off to a good start because you are starting so young but you want to be careful.  There&#039;s no need to put it all in the market in one day.  You can start a brokerage account and find a mutual fund, or you can pick stocks yourself.  some sites, like ***thewallstreethunter*** offer model portfolios, you can trade right along with their stock picks and expect the same returns,  I always suggest listening to the folks that know the most.  They tell you whats going on in the market and which stocks to buy.

Wow, I took a minute and looked at your answers, and people were pretty negative towards you. <br>
 <br>
To be honest, I&#039;m pretty proud of you for wanting to invest your cash. (Even though I&#039;m a perfect stranger!) <br>
 <br>
If I were you, I&#039;d invest it in some &quot;vending machines&quot; online. <br>
 <br>
For instance, take a look at this website: <br>
 <br>
http://***epregnancy-help***/ <br>
 <br>
This is what&#039;s called an AdSense website.  This website is currently up for bid for $10 on eBay. <br>
 <br>
Basically, someone buys this website, and makes money each time someone clicks on their links.  It&#039;s pretty simple. <br>
 <br>
If you bought this website, and attracted people to it, you could be making like $15 a day. <br>
 <br>
If you bought 10 websites like this, and attracted people to it, you could be making like $150 a day x 7 = $1050 a week. <br>
 <br>
How do I know all of this? <br>
 <br>
I teach people how to do it :) <br>
 <br>
Anyways, good luck! <br>
 <br>
Don&#039;t spend $5000 all in one place!!! <br>
