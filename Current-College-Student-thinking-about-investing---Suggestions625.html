<h1>Current College Student thinking about investing - Suggestions?</h1>
<div class="answer">Right now I&amp;#39;m attending a local community college, but will be finishing beginning of June.  From there I&amp;#39;ll have the summer off before I transfer to BYU-Hawaii. I will be working, but I&amp;#39;m hoping to get an edge up on my financial situation so that I don&amp;#39;t have to drag debt around for a long time.  So, I&amp;#39;m hoping to invest some money to maybe get going right now to be ready for when the big bills come from school.

What method of investment should I go for? I&amp;#39;ve always thought that Mutual Funds would be the smartest just out of mere safety, but would they take too long to show much return?  Would it be foolish to go into Stocks as a student, even though the market I think is a buyers market? I&amp;#39;m just looking for any advice for a young adult trying to get ahead of the game.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> I&#039;m a big fan of mutual funds, because they provide several advantages over other types of investments: <br>
 <br>
- Diversification - most funds invest in dozens (sometimes hundreds) of different securities, so you&#039;re not &quot;putting all your eggs in one basket.&quot; <br>
- Professional management - Usually it&#039;s a team of professionals who do all of the research and monitoring of the investments in the portfolio.  You can see how good they are at their job by looking at the fund&#039;s performance versus other similar funds and/or appropriate indices. <br>
- Convenience - You can get your account balance daily, and in most cases there is no charge to switch between funds.  Also, you can set up your fund account to draw automatic monthly investments regularly from your bank account (this is a great way to build up your balance). <br>
- Liquidity - Depending on the type of account (IRA, taxable, etc.), you generally can take out some or all of your money at any time. <br>
- Flexibility - there are thousands of different types of mutual funds for all types of investors.  Starting out with an index fund is a good idea, but as you learn more you might want to add different types of funds as well. <br>
 <br>
If you do go with mutual funds, be sure to invest with a fund company that has a good fund selection, low fees, and excellent customer service.  My favorite companies are Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, and Fidelity. <br>
 <br>
I hope that helps.  Good luck! <br>
 <br>
PS - GREAT idea to get started young.  Time is your best friend when it comes to investing.  Trust me - you will be very glad you started early!

There are varying degrees of risks involved with fund investing. You decide how you want your money invested, not the individual stocks, but the funds. <br>
 <br>
Some funds have moderate risk, volatile, venture, etc. <br>

        </p> my vote is going to Vandy.. optimistic they have been given a pair of cupcakes like Richmond yet.. 5 video games on the line vs good 25 communities and end the 365 days taking part in a house pastime vs the protecting ACC champion Wake Forrest... to no longer point out Alabama and Kentucky that are 2 extremely improved classes to Michael C.. certainly each time Auburn has entered preseason out of the best 10.. they have finished interior the best 5.. this 365 days.. they initiate @ #18.. they play no longer undemanding video games on the line the place they&#039;re 11-a million over the final 3 years.. and.. maximum heavily they in simple terms play ONE pastime at 11:30 ( a time they stink for some reason) and that&#039;s vs Mississippi St.. they play quite often at 2:30 and six:15 (cases they have performed properly).. if I have been a superstitious kind.. i could be in Vegas with some hundred to drop on Auburn to win the SEC.. btw the only loss on the line.. @ LSU while Vaughn missed 5 field targets and that they lost in OT a pastime they&#039;d desire to have gained.. additionally the only group from the SEC East to hold a win vs Auburn because of the fact that 2004 is Georgia.. and that they did it final 365 days.. Georgia hasn&#039;t overwhelmed Auburn in Athens because of the fact that i think of 2001.. something.. Tennessee is 0-3 against Auburn.. Vandy.. 0-a million.. Kentucky.. 0-2.. S. Carolina 0-2.. Florida 0-a million.. and Georgia whom they play each 365 days is a million-2 in final 3 years
