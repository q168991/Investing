</script><p> Yes. Anybody who is a citizen of the the country in which he lives and also in some other countries which allow others to trade and invest in shares, can invest in shares. But you must study the companies, their performance, return on your investment, Earning per Share ratio, dividends declared etc of the companies in which you will be investing. <br>

You can make lot of money if you are careful and do proper business in shares. You should also read a lot on the share market and financila magazines.

</script><p> Technically anybody of any age can invest in the stock market.  Stocks can be inherited or gifted to minors.   <br>
 <br>
However, to open an account or to buy or sell, the signature of a parent or guardian will be required because a minor (under 18 both in US and UK) cannot enter into a legal binding contract.
        </p> making an investment your money in distinctive ratios in differen companies is named Diversification.. It extremely reduces the possibility.. you&#039;re able to desire to choos the companies that are doing properly.. you&#039;re able to desire to examine the companies previous documents and the destiny.. If I have been you, i could initiate from making an investment with a minimum investment in a minimum danger corporation.. the alternative is yours !!! Do the appropriate !!
        </p> No, Minor can invest through his guardian only.
        </p> i think the investor should be 18 or you can have a demat account with a guardian assigned to it.
        </p> you need to set up a custodial account for anyone under 21.
        </p> i think you gotta be 18 :) cyeah
