<h1>The best way to start investing money?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am 25 years old and want to start investing money into stocks, bonds, and mutual funds. I recently opened an account with etrade, a savings account with 5% rate of return. I think this is a good start, but I would like to learn more on how investing is done. Is etrade a good place to invest with? Where can I learn about investments, websites? books?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> You should  invest in a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and money market funds. You want to buy a diversified portfolio of stocks as individual stocks are too risky. Most folks have a dificult time buying a properly balanced portfoilio of stocks on their own.  They will misbalance their portfolio by buying all small stocks or all growth stocks, or some other misbalanced assortment of stocks. Unless you know what you are doing, it is best to buy mutual funds.   I like Vanguard***, other people like Fidelity, TIAA-CREF, and DFA. Buy no-load, low cost funds. If you are like most people you will invest part of your money aggressively in stock funds, and part conservatively in money market funds and bond funds.  Vanguard*** has an on-line questionnaire which will give you an idea of how to do &quot;Asset Allocation,&quot; determining how much to put in each type of fund. <br>
 <br>
If your company offers a 401K plan at work, try to invest the most you can.  The money grows tax free, and some companies will match your contribution.  Investing in a mutual fund IRA is also a good idea. If you have children, you may want to consider a 529 plan or other college savings plan that grows tax free. <br>
 <br>
I like index funds. Because of their broad diversification, you are less likely to have a dramatic drop in value. They also have the lowest expenses.   For stock funds, I would suggest putting ~70-80% of your money in the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund. and ~20-30% in a foreign stock index fund.  However, there are many different opinions out there on what the best mutual funds are.  Read the links below and form your own opinion. <br>
 <br>
Buying a house instead of renting will save you a lot of money in the long run.  You don&#039;t have to pay rent and you build equity in your house instead.   Buying rental property can also be a good investment. However, being a landlord can be hard work, and many people are not good at it. If you don&#039;t know how to handle deadbeat renters, you can have trouble.  <br>
 <br>
If you have high-interest debt, like credit cards, it is best to pay this off first before trying most of the investment ideas above.  You should also  have 3-6 months of salary saved up as an emergency fund in a bank or money market fund before trying more risky investments.  <br>
 <br>
Believing advice you get on Yahoo answers can be risky, so read these websites for further information. If you find it too confusing, contact a professional financial advisor. They will charge you significant commissions, however.  <br>

Asset Allocation Calculators <br>
(Determining how much to put in stocks and how much into bonds and money markets is a personal decision depending on your financial status.  These Asset Allocation questionaires give you a rough idea how to do this.  I like Vanguard best, but try some of the other sites as well.) <br>

First, my questions: i. How much money do you have to invest? ii. What degree of risk are you willing to take? iii. How long are you willing to wait for the return? iv. Are you willing to share any great investing opportunity you get with other investors? Now, my suggestions: i. You must have at a least a few K&#039;s to get started, but a min of 1 K will do. ii. If you are a low risk taker, then look for the low return investment involving longer time. High risk = High return iii. Short term = High risk, Long term = Low risk iv. Share with others and earn on leverage. If you agree with my suggestion, you might get the right answer from the website below. Good Luck.
        </p> Only 5% ROI? That&#039;s weak. <br>
 <br>
Ave annual return on the stock market is 12% <br>
 <br>
Real Estate can be even higher. <br>
 <br>
Best place to start though is to buy books on investing, they can be your greatest investment. <br>
 <br>
The &quot;For Dummies&quot; series has several options and covers a lot of basic information for each of the major investing stratagies. <br>
 <br>
Now, they do draw conclusions for you, saying &quot;do this, don&#039;t do that&quot; and I don&#039;t agree with all of them, but again, they give good basic information which should help give you a basis to choose which investing opportunity and strategy is right for you.

You will have to wait between 3 and 10 days to get into the system in most cases. When I signed up it took 8 days. I wished it was faster, but if you can wait a week or two to start earn life changing money than you will have what it takes to make it in this business.
        </p> The truth is that i don&#039;t not have idea but the best way to earn a lot of money is to invest in any latin american country because you can do a monopolio with your bussiness in these contries
        </p> Check out ***suzeorman*** ***moneytrack.org for info to start. <br>
 <br>
BTW- haven&#039;t looked into it extensively, so no expert on this particular part here, but from my findings, Latin American mutual funds are in the toilet, with far lower earnings than other sectors- research carefully if you take 1st poster&#039;s advice.
