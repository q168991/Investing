</script><p> I wouldn&#039;t jump right in to it. Research the issues first and be certain that any money invested is money that you can afford to lose. Remember, all investments in the market are not winners. Some lose big time. First hand, you should have 3-6 months of funds available in an accessible account for emergency funds. Don&#039;t ever go without this if you&#039;re going to invest in the market as that rainy day could be just around the corner. Literature from brokerage houses or the NYSE could be a place to start learning.

        </p> The idea is to invest in shares of a company that is categorize into  <br>
Large,Big,Mid and Small Cap, <br>
You gain or lose as your shares goes up or down,and  as we all know the market is very volatile,but for long term Investment you can enter the market now. <br>
On the other hand if you are a short term Investors then you better stay away till the market are more stable.....
        </p> Your first option, should be to open a retirement account. This is always a good investment, regardless <br>
of who you are.  <br>
 <br>
If you have fully funded your retirement account and would like other options, you should consider a DRIP Plan.  <br>
 <br>
They are seldom recommended by brokers due to the low rate of commissions received. However, these  <br>
reinvestment plans can be very powerful long-term investments. Studies have shown that DRIP&#039;s are one of <br>
the best strategies on Wall Street.  <br>
 <br>
They are inexpensive and easy to start. New investors to the stock market should definitely consider a DRIP Plan. <br>
 <br>
Companies like Toyota, Royal Canadian Bank, Sony, Bank of America, General Electric and many other Blue Chip <br>
Stocks can be purchased through your DRIP Plan, with as little as 1 share in most cases.  <br>
 <br>
These long-term plans are great for beginners as well as veterans. Check them out.  <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Best of Luck
        </p> Now sensex is very low and this is the time to invest and wait for the market to bounce.There is no doubt if u invest now in June or July you can get minimum 35 to 45% return.
        </p> Go in for large caps and blue chips.  Do not trade in small and penny stocks just for the lure of getting high returns. <br>
 <br>
For a general discussion, Look at this good tutorial here:
        </p> select blue chip shares mostly lsited in A group. buy these and hold.  buy every month without caring for market changes. buy and hold is the best strategy provided that u invest at irregular intervals and select the shares wisely.
        </p> Well do not invest in stocks until july. You can start investing in ti after july.
        </p> refer stock market books
