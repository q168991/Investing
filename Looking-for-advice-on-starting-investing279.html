</script><p> Before you spend $0.01 on any investment, you must know what you’re doing, why you’re doing it and how to do it.  Before you invest in any security, the first investment you should make is in yourself, and the best investment you can make is by educating yourself.  <br>
 <br>
Begin your education by learning why you should invest and the importance of being able to make your own decisions or how the pro’s make theirs. Start your education by reading “Investing or Dummies” by Eric Tyson. <br>
To continue your education select some of the following  <br>

Websites that can provide instructions and help with procedures and terminology are Investopedia - http://***investopedia***/ http://***investorshub***/  and 1 Source for Stocks - http://***1source4stocks***/info/stock... or Smart Money  <br>
http://***smartmoney***/ <br>
Visit some of the more professional websites like  Zacks Research - http://***zacks***/ Schaeffer’s http://***schaeffersresearch***/ Investors Business Daily - http://***investors***/default.htm?fromad=1   <br>
Some of these web sites will have advertisers who are worth looking into also. And remember, if they offer free information, get it.   <br>
 <br>
Attend all the free seminars you can, just be careful and don’t get pressured into anything you really don’t want or need. Most schools offer courses in finance and economics, but very few will have courses on the mechanics of the investment markets, if they do try taking the course. You may want to consider on-line courses, the New York Institute of Finance use to have such courses. Try to get some fee information from The stocks exchanges they all have (had) free booklets, SIAC and some of the regulators (FINRA SEC MSRB CBOE) may provide some free literature. <br>
 <br>
And when you think you want to invest/trade, try some paper trading to test your skills without spending you money http://simulatorinvestopedia***/   http://***moneyworks4me***/  <br>
and/or http://***tradingsimulation***/  <br>
 <br>
You at least have made the right decision to start investing, this is the first big step and it won’t be your last. Keep taking those steps forward and along the way never take the advice from people that are not in the market or try to tell you not to invest. <br>
 <br>
Good luck on journey, study hard and you’ll invest well.

</script><p> Don&#039;t just jump in. Learn first... at least the basics.  Stay clear of Forex (Currency) for at least 3-5 years. Stay clear of stocks trading for less than $5... until you really know what you&#039;re doing (most people that know what they&#039;re doing avoid them 99% of the time).  Learn risk management.... understand you&#039;ll never do well until you do. <br>
 <br>
Read some good, basic books. Understand the difference between trading short term and investing long term. Long term investing is where most people succeed at least on some level. The shorter your time horizon.. the less likely you&#039;ll be profitable. <br>
 <br>
Look at low cost, no load Mutual Funds.... (Vanguard, T Rowe Price, Harbor and many more), not all fund companies are expensive. <br>
 <br>
Never stop learning.  Never use &quot;hope&quot; as a strategy.  Never buy a stock because the shares are &quot;so low&quot; or &quot;it&#039;s dropped so much&quot;. Never enter a trade with the attitude that it will make you a killing.
        </p> I use Scottrade and ShareBuilder, Sharebuilder has great features like &quot;auto invest&quot; and &quot;dividend reinvestment&quot;  <br>
Auto invest is great for getting dollar cost averaging (if your not that great on finding entry points) and Dividend Reinvestment is great for getting compounding interest with no fee for the trades. <br>
 <br>
In response to fund companies and anything else you may invest in, the cost for a good or service will have to be figured out mathematically. the S&amp;P 500 delivered a total return of 16.0% in 2012. If an investment company (after all my fees) can return more than that I would consider letting them hold some of my money. Just think of them as a stock and ask the question..Are you making me money on my money?
        </p> Its the best thing you can do to take control of your own finances as you are behoven to nobody but yourself. Take the advice above and start learning before dipping your toes in as its a game where you will never know it all and a little knowledge can be a bad thing. There are loads of online resources that will give you the basics and the rest will be up to you. Happy Trading!
        </p> Check out different brokers online and find out what commission plans they are offering. Also ask about any hidden fees that they may have. Don&#039;t invest large sum at first. Start with a little and add more only after you are comfortable.
