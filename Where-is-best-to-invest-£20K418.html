<div class="answer">I have £20K that I want to invest long term, say 4 years, nothing too risky. Can anyone advise what is the best investment / savings plan?

</script><p> If you are considering shares then the &quot;safest&quot; investment is probably an index tracker fund.  These are investment vehicles that distribute shares across an index in the same ratio as the index itself. This means that the fund &quot;tracks&quot; the growth rate of the index itself i.e. it duplicates the performance of a stock market index. <br>
 <br>
For example, if the FTSE 100 index grows by 10% in a year, then a FTSE 100 index tracker should grow at the same rate. Obviously this is based on the assumption that the index grows. They always do over a long period of time, however, the current global economic climate means that it is not guaranteed over a relatively short period such as four years. However, if you combine an index tracker with an ISA, you can be pretty sure that your investment will give good returns. <br>

 <br>
Interest rates on savings accounts are high at the moment (banks are trying to attract savings to shore up balance sheets). <br>
 <br>
It is unusual to have rates two full points higher than the BOE base rate and this certainly won&#039;t last.  Inflationary pressures are reducing and there could well be a base rate cut in the next month or two. <br>
 <br>
I would lock in now - there are good rates at Kaupthing Edge, ICICI Bank, Anglo Irish and Birmingham Midshires.  There are others too, giving a return of 7% or more (gross).  You don&#039;t say if you are a tax payer and what rate - that could affect your decision.

        </p> In my years of trading in the stock market long term is the most dangerous. It is easy for me to predict short term stock moves but who can predict how a business will be 4 years from now? Give this some thought. Long term investing=Losing all your money <br>
