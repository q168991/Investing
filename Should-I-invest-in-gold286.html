</script><p> gold can benefit you as an investor in a number of ways. Gold has lasting value, can be bought and sold quickly and easily, and is a recognized asset of last resort. <br>
Perhaps gold&#039;s most enduring benefit is its ability to diversify and stabilize a portfolio and protect it against stock market fluctuations. Most importantly, when you buy the right gold, it&#039;s completely private and non-reportable.  <br>
&quot;Is now the right time to buy?&quot; With gold, the answer is always the same: Yes. Gold is an investment for the long run. The right time to buy gold is when you understand what it is and what it can do for your portfolio. <br>
This following report details why you need gold and what gold can do for your portfolio. <br>
 Gold - A Long Term Storehouse of Value. Historically, gold acts as a reliable &quot;store of value&quot; and gold fulfills all the functions of money. <br>
 Gold is portable and divisible, easy to store in an emergency and far more reliable than paper money in a crisis. <br>
 Gold is indestructible, relatively scarce, and cannot be &quot;manufactured.&quot; It&#039;s value cannot be inflated away like paper currency. <br>
 Gold is recognizable and acceptable as a form of payment making it easy to buy, sell or trade worldwide. <br>
Gold is Once Again in Favor <br>
In the 1990&#039;s, gold prices traded down while stock prices were high and inflation was low. Historically, gold&#039;s best friend has been inflation. Energy shock and oil shortages can create both temporary and permanent economic inflation. Most recently, the combination of extremely low interest rates, the Federal Reserve flooding the market with paper money after 9/11, and energy prices now double or triple what they were two years ago has brought inflation back into the U.S. economy.  <br>
Economic cycles are permanent facts of life and one of the best reasons to acquire gold. Even though gold prices fluctuate, over the long term, gold has maintained its long-term value. In contrast, most currencies (including the U.S. dollar) and industrial commodities have generally declined in value due to inflation. Even as little as 3% inflation a year will destroy half of the buying power of your savings in less than 17 years. <br>
In years when energy shock dominated the U.S. economy, the Federal Reserve was not able to stop the inflationary spiral regardless of how high they took interest rates. Is history about to repeat itself? Could we be seeing just a glimpse of the destruction inflation can create. <br>
1979 Was An Historic Year for Gold <br>
To put inflation into perspective, let&#039;s look at how inflation hit the average American household in 1979. Rising prices hit commodities, the gas pump, and moved across the economy like wildfire. <br>
 First, sugar went from 19 cents a pound to well over $1.00. <br>
 Coffee tripled in price. <br>
 Gasoline prices soared as it became hard to get; long lines become common. <br>
 Middle East tensions exploded when Iran seized the American Embassy. <br>
 Interest rates rose quickly and the prime interest rate reached an historic 21%. <br>
 In three months time, gold prices went to $850/ounce. Silver traded over $50 an ounce. <br>
Gold Rose from $35 to $850, a 2,400% Increase <br>
Hard to imagine now, but it happened- driven in no small part by a lack of confidence in U.S. leaders and energy shock. Over five years, gold had made a long, hard climb from $35 per ounce to trade between at an amazing level of $100 to $200 by early 1979. As investors worldwide panicked out of the weak U.S. Dollar, gold prices topped $850 an ounce. <br>
That&#039;s an 8-fold increase in the price of gold in a year! <br>
Will such an event occur again?  We just don&#039;t know for sure. But, we are worried, very worried about exactly the same kind of events that we see in place today. Led by a weak President and a new Federal Reserve Chief, the market might panic again.  <br>
Exactly the right events were in place in the 1970&#039;s- a combination of rapidly rising energy prices creating energy shock, inflation in commodities, a serious Middle East crisis, and the Federal Reserve&#039;s constant raising of interest rates.

</script><p> Yes it is.  Especially while you can get it under $1K.  A gold ETF is the easiest way to invest. <br>
 <br>
Forget all these fast money predictions.  Unless you really know what you&#039;re doing it may be best to buy a proportion of gold as part of a diversified portfolio as a long-term investment then you don&#039;t have to worry about short-term price fluctuations between $800-$1000.  When you filter out volatility, that&#039;s just price consolidation before the commodity move up higher.   <br>
 <br>
On a quarterly chart gold has been on a long-term trend since mid 2001.  Some people say gold goes up during a recession, others say it goes up to hedge against inflation.  So it can go up either way. <br>
 <br>
I have no idea what the feds decision will do to gold prices.  I assume it will make financial stocks go higher.
        </p> Fed&#039;s decision to buy the toxic assets of banks and mortgage companies means minting green backs and putting it in circulation without any immediate productive return. This action has the potential to bring down the gold reserve of the fed proportionate to Dollar in circulation. If the gold reserve goes below the standard the fed may decide to buy gold to cover the green back put to circulation in buying the toxic assets. Whether the earlier peak will be surpassed is anybody&#039;s guess. Considering all aspects of the market it will not be unwise to invest in gold at this stage.
        </p> Never invest in gold.  If you have surplus money invest liquid securities like Bank deposits and this deposits are as good as currency.  Gold never gets an equivalent amount of cash for its value.  If you go for selling you will always get lesser amount.  Moreover the increase in price is very meagre for the past 50 years when compared an investment in Bank deposit, mutual fund, stock market and real estate.
        </p> . It has not been that price in over a month. Maybe on the overnight but i doubt it. Its reasonable to say it will reach 1000 again but very short term. traders switch to gold just for ticks thats why you see a fluctuation on the price. When gold goes up they are trading gold because they pull their money from stocks and trading s and p day trading. Gold i believe is 25 dollars a tick so there is money to be made. But you need about 20k to trade it unless you trade the options or gold refiner stocks which is worthless to own unless you have about 100k to invest. So to close if you think that you trade gold on stocks, im sorry but you are mistaken. But if you trade it daily on the emini futures then you have a chance at real money.  <br>
good luck and yes it will reach your price again but very short term.
        </p> I don&#039;t think it is a right time to invest in Gold. I would just suggest just wait and watch should be the policy at this juncture. The price of the gold is so high that no one should think of investing in Gold at such a high price. Just wait for a correction and then buy.
        </p> 1. Yes it is the right time but <br>
2. It may not possible for a few years <br>
3. In present trends to buy gold is the safe investment.  Rates have gone to much higher level and it may not climbe up for some times.  It  may not show a quick return.  Later on when market is steady the rates will go up.
        </p> In general gold as an asset class is considered to be the best hedge against inflation.Accordingly the inflation in India is nose diving and has almost touched zero level.Therefore your capital is automaticlly being hedged by present falling trend of inflationa.In fact the present finacial crisis wrt an investor point of view is all about liquidity concerns and in such scenerio CASH is the king. Therefore if you have cash in hand,you are king. If you wish to add value to this cash and plan to remain invested with 2-3 years horizon in mind, Mutual Fund and bluechip stocks are the best bet at present valuation of SENSEX.
        </p> Yes, you should invest in gold.  <br>
The price is about to rise even higher in next 2-3 years
        </p> I dont know where the one poster got 850 an oz. It has not been that price in over a month. Maybe on the overnight but i doubt it. Its reasonable to say it will reach 1000 again but very short term. traders switch to gold just for ticks thats why you see a fluctuation on the price. When gold goes up they are trading gold because they pull their money from stocks and trading s and p day trading. Gold i believe is 25 dollars a tick so there is money to be made.

good luck and yes it will reach your price again but very short term.  <br>
Another sign by the way is war. Everytime its war time gold stays up. many electronics use gold so do missiles and other weapons.
        </p> This is not the best of times to invest in gold.  Pl wait for a couple of months when the prices should fall below $820/- Best of luck
         Yes it is.  Especially while you can get it under $1K.  A gold ETF is the easiest way to invest. <br>

        </p> For Gold investments for 2014, pls read this article: http://***myinvestmentspub***/2014/07/how-to-invest-buy-in-gold-goldcoin-gold.html
        </p> For Long Term Business : Buy Gold in July. It will be in the lowest rates. Then hold for 5 months, sell it in feb. You will earn approx rs 2k per 10 grams. <br>
 <br>
For Short Term Business : Buy it now and check prices daily (Not in TV) at jewelery shops and sell under a week. you will get approx rs 400 to 600 per 10 grams.
        </p> i don&#039;t think it is the right time because the price is very high after 1 or 2 yrs it might come down but i am not sure in case if the price goes high and remains the same then its an good idea to invest in gold.
        </p> I feel you should not buy Gold at high rates (that are currently seen due to uncertainty experienced by investors in current world financial situation). Because Gold is finallly a commodity and will likely to correct like other commodities do. Buy at that time if you wish.
        </p> Yes, this is the right time to invest in gold .Gold is generally considered as one of the safest investment . When the economy goes down, gold goes up.
        </p> yes. it is the right time 2 buy gold since price of gold is not going to decrease. Be sure that u buy gold coins instead of ornaments so that we will get the rate of that day when you sell the gold
        </p> Investing i gold is always befecial. <br>
You can invest anytime and in the long run you&#039;ll reap rich rewards.
        </p> Better wait for some more time until the gold rate is extremely low at around 750$ or somewhere near that and sell it when the next depression arrives.
         In the present global scene of recession people have little money to invest but only to feed their family. There is no excess money around to pool in gold or land or shares. There will soon be a selling spree of past investments, and past gold investors will come to sell for their liquidity. They will sell their investments, and gold will be one to sell easily. The price of gold will drop sharply. You need to eat but cannot eat gold.
        </p> There is a trend. When the economy goes down, gold goes up. It happened in the Great Depression. Now, we&#039;re in a Second Great Depression. I would advise you to buy it but don&#039;t chicken out when it goes down. In the long-term, 6 months to several years, there will be a profit. Especially at the price it is now! BUY!!!
        </p> yes definitely this is the write time to invest on gold..Because the rate is going high and peoples will never mind about the rate they have to be richfull.Even it cross 15000 a gram peoples are ready to buy it..it came as a day to day life for peoples..
        </p> As the  world economy facing recession i think the Gold &amp; crude price may  remain firm and you should invest in the both comodities
        </p> No, with the current economic state it&#039;s dangerous to invest in anything. Unless you have a very strong work position don&#039;t do it.
        </p> no its not a right time to buy gold because gold is move on top i think gold is will come 13950 or 14000 .if then you buying this rate you are safe and got a many many profit.
        </p> As considering long term Investment, gold is the safest invest for every time.
        </p> hi i te share market is high just go for gold coins as that gold market will be down and if u are properly from india thn buy the gold when there is no season of marriages ,
        </p> its always better to invest where u u know that value will increase <br>
and gold is one of those items <br>
in coming years gold price is expected to reach 25000 per 10 grams and it will not come down
        </p> don&#039;t think the right time or bed time for investing on gold.It is one of the best savings also. so buy gold whenever u can.
         Compar this month gold rate and previous month gold then buy.I prefer buying gold.It is a good investment.
        </p> Not Now . Its not right time to buy Gold
        </p> wel,now a days the rate of gold is 15,000 per 10gm. It is the right time to buy a gold,if u will be late than may be you get it.
        </p> Well its all time high right now. Its right now almost the same high as in share market was some time back @ 20 K Levels.. so Hold on..
        </p> no, its not right time, the price of gold is on high and this is a recessin period so i suggest you to invest in real-estate market now a days market of real-estate goig down so its a best time to purchasing and when market would gone high you get double profit....
        </p> You just search on daily news papers to collect details about gold. <br>
 <br>
that&#039;s how you can understand is it time to go ahead or not?
        </p> No I don&#039;t think So , Thi is the correct time to invest in Share Market or in Mutial Fund ,
        </p> This is not the time to buy, and with in 3to4 months the price will be down and will be steady for years together.
        </p> gold is likely to face a price slash in the next month if the value of the <br>
rupee is static or +,in case the rupee value decreases then there may be a different analysis.
        </p> hi, i think you should get details about gold. what the current price is.. well you should go for investment in gold.. this would be the better option 4 u. and way to earn. thanks
         If you have uncountable and unaccountable money, you can buy anything. <br>
For Gold there is no time, you should have money. <br>
Investment on land is always good than Gold.
        </p> It is hovering around USD 950.  You please wait for some sharp correction in the gold prices before investment.
        </p> gold is likely to face a price slash in the next month if the value of the
        </p> No. not at all. to invest in gold wait until share markets boom. on that time invest in gold.
        </p> this is not wright time wait for some time gold rates will come down im sure
        </p> Don&#039;t invent now, <br>
 I suggest you all not to involve in these kind of activities, because it creates speculated value not &quot;Real Value&quot;. its a big gambling. <br>
 <br>
You people want to make money with out working and creating demand which is not real.
        </p> yes. it is right time. since no equity is getting anything and also <br>
the same fate with real estate business. hence gold is the best <br>
for investment.
