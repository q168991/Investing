<h1>Need some advice for a person looking to get out of short term for awhile?</h1>
<div class="answer">I&amp;#39;m looking to get out of this short term thing because whenever I lose money I get severely stressed. I used 10k as the fixed amount and split it among four stocks that are poised to jump (I sell within 4 days no matter what). So far, I made on average of 8% on each stock over the past month. 

Today, however, my luck came to an end and I lost 15% of my principal , was forced to sell and bite a $64 commission fee. I think I paid over $400 in commission fees. After the loss, I was left with a paltry 3k.

I think I spent about 5 hours day researching and scouting out companies. The emotional toll has been horrendous. I feel mind bent, cannot stop thinking about investing, and have trouble sleeping. For such a small payout, it was definitely not worth it and I feel awful about the decision.

Is there some stock/etf with proven growth which I can lock up for 2 years and never look at (would it even be worth it with the new Obama health care tax)?

Finally, this has been an experience that has taught me a lot about myself. I don&amp;#39;t think I have the nerves of steel to endure in this industry. Can it be developed or am I going out on a whim to think I can improve it? I hear all those stories about 90 hour work weeks and pulling two nighters; I don&amp;#39;t think I could survive that. I think I want a job in finance, yet I&amp;#39;m 22 years old and soon to graduate college.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Don&#039;t get discouraged.  Your emotional disarray sounds appropriate to the scenario. <br>
 <br>
You have a modest knowledge of investing.  Yet you have attempted aggressive short term trading, one of the more challenging ways to invest.  The results are not surprising. <br>
 <br>
Consider VTSMX (Vanguard Total Stock Market) or its ETF equivalent.  Get 5-10 years of long term investing experience before trying anything short term again. <br>
 <br>
An investment banking job at Goldman might require 90 hour weeks.  The vast majority of investment jobs are more reasonable.  Good challenges, great rewards. <br>
 <br>
Go back through some of your earlier questions.  Some of the advice you rejected may make a lot more sense now.

</script><p> Actually what you did is what many others have done, thinking they can guess the market and make frequent trades like that, and the story is almost always the same.   Your best bet is to make longer term investments and scale in / out.   Jmo.   When you are out of college, my advice is to sign up for actions alerts plus and trade with them, so you get in the right stocks and also learn how they do it. <br>
 <br>
Obviously you can&#039;t panic when down on a stock, because you will always be down on a stock at times because no one can ever pick the absolute bottom.
        </p> Ever heard of a stop loss order? <br>
 <br>
Yes, you should stop trading until you learn something. Practice is for the simulator, where you develop your strategy, where you learn to execute, and test it to see if you can actually execute it. Or you&#039;re going to have an expensive education.
