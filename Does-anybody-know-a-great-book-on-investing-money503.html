<h1>Does anybody know a great book on investing money?</h1>
<div class="answer">I&amp;#39;ve have no idea about investing or CDs or money accounts, etc.  I wanted to know if there is a great book that could teach me how to invest my money and also about all the different types of investments i could do.  I wanted a more recent book that was written this year.  If anybody knows any books that would teach me all about investing please let me know.  Thank you!<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Buying a financial book basically is buying a book about what took place yesterday, which means nothing today. You will learn much more by reading, reading, and reading current magazines, such as Fortune, BusinessWeek, Money Magazine, Wall Street Journal.  <br>
Also if you have time, you need to watch CNBC on tv, as they discuss in great detail the ever changing markets.  <br>
Also look up some of the money sites online on a regular basis. <br>
Do this over a period of several months, get some ideas, do not rush into anything, then get a broker you can trust who shares your ideas and ideals, and work from there.
        </p> Investing for Dummies by Eric Tyson is a great beginner book but it was not published written this year. <br>
 <br>
A new book, scheduled to come out soon is &quot;How A Second Grader Beats Wall Street: Golden rules Any Investor Can Learn.&quot; by Allan Roth.
        </p> Don&#039;t have that book, but everything you really need to know regarding top performance sectors of the market place and more can be found at  http://***mutualfundwealth***/  Exciting times for investing good luck in your endeavors.
