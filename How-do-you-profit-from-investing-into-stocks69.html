<h1>How do you profit from investing into stocks?</h1>
<div class="answer">I&amp;#39;m looking into investing in the stock market, because its something ive always wanted to do. But i would like to know how and when do you start seeing profits from investing, and when you do see the profits are you liable to touch that money at the moment or are you supposed to let sit there for awhile. I know this might sound funny but i&amp;#39;m a real real beginner. I just dont want to do anything that I&amp;#39;m going to regret.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Stay away from TD Ameritrade  and Scottrade. <br>
 <br>
They are for the &quot;more experienced&quot; investor. Both are very good..... but not right now. <br>
 <br>
Start with Charles Schwab or Fidelity Brokerage.  <br>
 <br>
Read as much as you can. Never invest in anything you don&#039;t understand. Never invest in &quot;tips&quot; (from people you know or talking heads in any media). <br>
 <br>
Start with Mutual Funds or basic ETF&#039;s. Don&#039;t invest a penny until you have an &quot;Asset Allocation&quot;. Don&#039;t deviate from your asset allocation model. <br>
 <br>
Be aware the biggest threats to profitability are; <br>
Indecision <br>
Fear <br>
Greed <br>
 <br>
You can do this. Just take your time learning!

</script><p> Open an online brokerage account. There are many to choose from such as TD-Ameritrade, ScottTrade, E-Trade etc. Purchase stock in a company, at least a $1000 position. <br>
Watch daily as your stock price goes up and down. Sell when your losses are too high or sell when you think the stock price will not go up any higher. I usually wait for a down trend to start before I start to sell my winners. To profit from the stock market, on the average you need to make more than you loose i.e. <br>
 <br>
Gain = #Shares*(SoldPrice - BuyPrice) - 2*TransactionFee. <br>
 <br>
Prior to using real money, you should try paper trading stocks. Pretend to buy/sell. Keep track of your gains and losses to see how well or not you are doing. There are websites that allow you to paper trade. Read up on technical analysis of the stock market. Good Luck. Having luck is executing with a prepared mind.
