</script><p> To Start Investing                                                                         <br>
It takes a long time to learn the stock market and it would help if you read some books and information online.  Before you start investing in the market the first thing you need to decide is what risk level you want to take.  CDs backed up by the government has about 3-4% annual return for the long term with a low risk.  Bonds or Bonds Funds has about 5-7% annual return for the long term with a medium risk.  Stocks or Stock Mutual Funds has about 8-10% annual return for the long term with a high risk and are more volatile than Bonds. A person could make more than 10% annual return with the right investment. Usually the more risk you take, the more return you will have, but not always.  To see the Risk vs Return go to my photo:   http://i1142.photobucket***/albums/n620...   The stock market is basally made up of stocks and bonds.  Investment managers pick a group of stocks to make a mutual fund or a group of bonds to make a bond fund.  They even put a mixture of stocks and bonds together and call it a Growth &amp; Income Fund.   <br>
  <br>
1- MUTUAL FUNDS: I like mutual funds because they have a group of stocks (could be around 100+) invested in different sectors, and manage by a professional. Managers have lots of schooling for investing in stocks, around 8 years. So I think managers can pick stocks better than I can. You can make a buy or sell order anytime of the day for mutual funds shares but it will not go in affect until the close of the day. There are lots of different kinds of mutual funds that does not charge any fees to buy it&#039;s shares and they are called Noload Funds. There are also some funds called Load Funds that charge about 5% of your investment. But what I don&#039;t like is the fact that most funds has trading restriction and you may not be able to trade more than 4 times a year. That&#039;s because it makes it hard for the fund to make a good return if there is to much trading in the fund, causing the fund manager to make more buys and sells and keep more cash on hand. Mutual funds are meant for long term investors. <br>
2- STOCKS: Stocks is more volatile than funds unless you spread you money in about ten different sectors and know witch sector will do best. Stock trading restriction is only a few days and that&#039;s something that I like. If you own stocks, you will need to keep up with all the company&#039;s business so you don&#039;t get stuck with a bad stock. That could take a lots of time. I think a person that buys a few stocks is taking more risk hoping to make a bigger return. If that&#039;s the case, look at the leverage ETFs. <br>
3- ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds): ETFs are like a mutual fund but trades like a stock and that is my main reason why I like ETFs. There are some ETFs that represents Index&#039;s. An Index is like S&amp;P or DOW. Index&#039;s operate just like a mutual fund with a group of stocks in deferent sectors, manage by professionals.  You can&#039;t buy Index&#039;s because they are not for sell.  A company owns them.  But you can buy a mutual funds or an ETF that has the same stocks as the Index they represent. There are a lots of different kinds of ETFs for someone to choose from. Some have 1x leverage, some have 2x leverage for aggressive investors, and some has 3x leverage for more aggressive investors. There are some that represent almost every kind of sector.    <br>
 <br>
You can find several good brokers that charge $8.00 and under, per stock trade and no fee on Noload Funds. Most broker websites have good research tools. Some popular broker websites are Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, E-trade, Scottrade and others.  I think you need a min. of $500 (some sites $2,500) to open a broker account and need to be at lease 18 years old. If you not 18, you might could get your Dad to open an account for you. <br>

</script><p> I always seem to end up having to tell my girlfriends this, &quot;You can only spend a dollar once!!!&quot;.   Do you really have $2,000 to invest or is this money that you will be needing for something in the near future?   If you can do without this $2,000 for the next 10 to 20 years than you can invest it but otherwise you have to plan your cash flow.   Almost everyone will at some point look at their bank balance and think they have X amount of money to spend but in fact they don&#039;t, your monthly minimum balance in your bank account is closer to what you have available not the balance that you often see, some of that money has already been spoken for, whether it&#039;s for rent, a car payment or food. <br>
 <br>
So do you really have $2,000 to invest?   Most likely not, the first thing you need to do is separate your money as to what they are intended for.   Most banks will allow you to open multiple bank accounts and manage them all from the same web login ID.   Take advantage of that and name each account by what the money is for.   At the very least you should have four categories, spend, save, donate and invest.   The spend is so that you don&#039;t make an investment decision simply because you wanted to buy something.   The save is so that you don&#039;t make an investment decision just because an emergency cropped up.  The donate is so that you don&#039;t make an investment decision just because you wanted to help someone.   If you don&#039;t have the discipline to divide your money then you just don&#039;t have what it takes to control your own finances, let alone invest.
        </p> You could put it in a bank, but if you want to try online investing you should study market news letters like Motley Fool, etc. Or read the Wall Street Journal. Actually a cash account on the online brokerage sites like TD Ameritrade offer more interest than some banks. A Certificate Of Deposit could also work, but many aren&#039;t paying a lot now.
        </p> The interest you will receive in savings accounts is unlikely to even keep up with inflation. When are you going to need the money? If you, for example, are 100% sure you will not need the money for 8-10 years, I would suggest investing in mutual funds of your choosing (I suggest straight index funds). If you need within 5 years don&#039;t risk it in the market.
        </p> Talk to a financial advisor. If the money will be needed soon (within the next few years), keep it in a safe investment like an ing savings account. If you can take more risk and don&#039;t need the money soon, you will have other options - stocks, mutual funds, etc. An advisor can explain the risks and rewards involved with these.
        </p> You can&#039;t succed in binary trading without a strategy, a good method to follow and some kind of software support. They program I use is called &quot;Autobinary signals&quot;. It helps finding loopholes for guaranteed returns. It&#039;s very easy to use and I&#039;m earning good money. You find all the details on this site: http://tradingsignal.toptips.org
        </p> Penny stocks are loosely categorized companies with share prices of below $5 and with market caps of under $200 million. They are sometimes referred to as &quot;the slot machines of the equity market&quot; because of the money involved. There may be a good place for penny stocks in the portfolio of an experienced, advanced investor, however, if you follow this guide you will learn the most efficient strategies https://tr.im/c8109
        </p> With penny stocks you can make 30 percent or 40 percent profit in a few days. Learn here https://tr.im/OAepk <br>
 <br>
The best strategy, if you do have experience type of return on a penny stock, is to sell the stock quickly.  <br>
 <br>
Of course, it’s easier said than done. The natural thing to want when you see an increase in stock price is to hold the stock and hope for an even larger increase.
        </p> At the Time all investment is risk involve but the secure investment is Deposit your money in to bank get the interest from bank. This is best way to get the return &amp; save you investment. <br>

        </p> I can&#039;t help you obisiouly. A lot ppl has opnions to say they invest money in college, car, church , etc. But I would invest , if i have that much money, in donation such as HSUS , St. Jude, Hungry Children World, etc. and then give some to church to help paying bills and get more equiments, interprers, and building and get a new house for myself . Also invest some for my own house bills in saving account and college. If you need a new car because it is an old car then get one. But don&#039;t do crazy things to get something you dont need. Because when you spend money on thing you dont need, you will forget important things and keep spending until money is gone in a min.

i have attended a lot of seminars, read counless books on forex trading and it all cost me thousands of dollars. the worst thing was i blew up my first account. after that i opened another account and the same thing happened again. i started to wonder why i couldn,t make any money in forex trading. at first i thought i knew everything about trading. finally i found that the main problem i have was i did not have the right mental in trading. as we know that psychology has great impact on our trading result. apart from psychology issue, there is another problem that we have to address. they are money management, market analysis, and entry/exit rules. to me money management is important in trading. i opened another account and start to trade profitably after i learnt from my past mistake. i don&#039;t trade emotionally anymore.  <br>
if you are serious about trading you need to address your weakness and try to fix it. no forex guru can make you Professional trader unless you want to learn from your mistake.
        </p> You can invest your money in stoke market.
