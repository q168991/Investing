</script><p> The purpose of the stock market is to invest your money in sound companies that make money or speculate for instance lately Gold is being bid up as Europe melts down over Greece. So sometimes your investment is speculative because of panic people bidding prices up and wanting to own Gold at any price. Just make sure to get out and don&#039;t wait for a bottom since stocks and commodities can be volatile.   <br>
 <br>
 In general, you want companies with rapidly growing revenues or with hot products such as Apple with the iTouch and iPad or a good restaurant with tasty food such as Buffalo Wild Wings with a good Sports Bar touch or Yum Brands that does fast food franchises such as KFC, Pizza Hut and Taco Bell that is rapidly opening in China.  You want to bank off successful companies since your investing into the companies which means your a shareholder with paycheck return on investment if the company does well.   <br>
 <br>
No body knows the future however women in general make better investors than men since they like to buy value plays and good companies.  Many good investments start at the mall or seen on television.  Look for the hottest fashion trends such as Coach bags or Uggs (Just examples - already out of fashion) or what store or product that you have passion in.  For instance if you like movies at home maybe Redbox with company Coinstar is on your watch list or Netflix instead of Blockbustor since you like DVD&#039;s in the mail or online.   <br>
 <br>
It&#039;s best to look at the annual report for Research - just look at Yahoo Finance under the news or go to a company website generally under Investor info.  Learn to read the financials for instance is it profitably?  What is the profit margin?  Are there expenses under control?   <br>
 <br>
Taking business class trains you to be an Entrepreneur or ask questions on how to succeed.  Don&#039;t worry if you don&#039;t know that&#039;s why your taking the class.  Learn and seize the day and find how to invest.  If you haven&#039;t started then invest $100 into the stock market or mutual fund and save for your retirement or first home or college. <br>
 <br>
The stock market is unique since it makes risk takers rich if the company is a sucess.  So learn about the newest companies especially IPO&#039;s or initial public offerings that are listing on the exchanges.  Look at the trends for instance trade publications or new products.  Read the business section and watch CNBC or Bloomberg.  Good luck!
