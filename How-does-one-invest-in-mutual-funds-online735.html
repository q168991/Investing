</script><p> Ah yes Mutual Funds.  A collection of stocks in one investment vehicle to  <br>
 <br>
1) Hedge against risk from one stock alone <br>
2) Diversify your portfolio because this drops risk <br>
3) Drop the NAV on it and you see a little gain <br>
4) Try to dodge and weave through endless MF to find one that you aren&#039;t being taken advantage of through high maintenance costs <br>
 <br>
and 5) you still lose all your money in a downturn.  A bull market though it goes up but not as much as stocks.  Sweet deal if you ask me. <br>
 <br>
In 2008 1 Mutual Fund made money at the return of .04 percent.  Brokers make the real money here but you can go to Vanguard and really see their mutual funds.Morning star rates these vehicles as well but I wouldn&#039;t take their word on it from your hard earned money.  TdAmeritrade is a spot of information.

</script><p> If you wish to invest online in mutual funds, please check the Mutual AMC website. Not all of them allow online purchase (e.g.Tata Mutual fund does not have online investing ability but  birla, sbi does) <br>
 <br>
For the first purchase, most of them will ask you to subsequently sent PAN proof, and signature, thereafter subsequent purchase can be made online. <br>
 <br>
If you open a demat account with sharekhan with online transaction facility, you can buy/sell in mostly all kind of mutual funds online without any physical documents and without any entry loads
        </p> Yes Possible <br>
Now many AMC Provide online investing like Birla, Reliance.HDFC <br>
visit that particular site of AMC and invest online.
        </p> I think it might be possible.  Here is a link to the mutual funds of India where you can find information on how to invest in them.   <br>

 <br>
I do know that Reliance does allow on line fund purchase.  Here is their link. <br>

 <br>
Good luck.
        </p> I think these days almost everything is accessible through internet but it depends on the person and his knowledge about various facilities and services that are available. I think you should try the service of portfolio tracker and mobile update services provided by Mansukh because it will help you out in understanding the market as well as keeping track of your investments
