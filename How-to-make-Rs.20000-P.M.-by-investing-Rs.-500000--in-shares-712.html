</script><p> Hi RAM SARAN BHARDWAJ, <br>
Stock/forex business is very volatile and too risky for beginner. You should find the trader who could manage your funds. <br>
20k from 500k is 4%. It is similar percentage that I pay to my investors. <br>
I&#039;m forex trader. If you would like I could manage your funds at managed account, i.e. you place funds into trading account under full your control and I would trade from your account. <br>
If you are interesting in such collaboration then please PM or email me (press my name). <br>
 <br>
But if you are interesting to start your own trading then you should begin your self-education from those books: <br>
Market Wizards by Jack D. Schwager; <br>
Technical Analysis by Jack D. Schwager; <br>
Comprehensive Course on The Wave Principle by A.J. Frost and Robert Prechter; <br>
Candlestick Charting Explained- Timeless Techniques for Trading Stocks and Futures by Gregory L. Morris; <br>
Trading Chaos – Applying Expert Techniques to Maximize Your Profit by Bill Williams; <br>
New Trading Dimensions by Bill Williams <br>
Then you should go to the training course and after 3-6 month practice on demo account you&#039;ll be able to start your own trading. <br>
 <br>
However while you&#039;ll be learning stock/fx trading it could be earned amazing income <br>
 <br>
I hope for a long and successful collaboration

        </p> IT WOULD BE BETTER TO INVEST FOR MEDIUM TERM(3-6 MONTHS)  AND ON THE AVERAGE MONTHLY BASIS YOU WILL BE ABLE TO EARN MORE THAT 20K PER MONTH OUT OF YOUR INVESTED MONEY. THERE ARE MANY WHO WOULD BE GIVING TELLING YOU TO INVEST IN FUTURES AND OPTIONS. AS YOU ARE SAYING THAT YOU ARE A BIGINER SO FIRST START INVESTMENTS IN EQUITY SEGMENTS. ONLY 50% OF THE NET INVESTMENT. AFTER YOU FEEL COMFORTALBE THEN ENTER THE FUTURE SEGMENT WHICH ON AN AVERAGE GIVES DAILY 1-2% OF YOUR NET INVESTMENT (IN EVERY 2-3 DAYS BASIS) <br>
 <br>
WITH LOVE <br>

        </p> Take a look at ***quarantz*** They offer great profits and are open to all your questions without charging you. 4% per month is absolutely no problem, there&#039;s even more to gain. Be sure to get good advice before doing anything, especially when you want to do it by yourself, because stock and forex market are not easy things for beginners. Good luck.
        </p> Investing in shares and making money requires specialized learning and experience. I would recommend you start investing by risking a small amount initially.  <br>
