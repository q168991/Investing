        </p> It means gambling on Stocks or mutual funds. <br>
You buy shares (part of a company) for a price and hope in time the price increases. <br>
Say you buy shares in Yahoo.   It costs $16 a share.  You gamble that in 6 to 12 months the value increases to $36 a share.  Then you sell, giving you a profit of $20 a share. <br>
The gamble is the value could go down instead of up and the share is now worth $10 thus you lost $6 a share.    Tell Mom that before she invests she and you pick a few companies, check the price of a share in each company.  Keep a written list and every day you check online to see if the value increased.  This will familiarize you with investing and not cost you a penny.  Once the two of you are confident and understand what you are doing then mom invests the money <br>
Your library should have the book &quot;Investing For Dummies&quot; so borrow it and the two of you read it and learn
        </p> Investment is putting money into something that you hope will grow and become more valuable. Watch the Facebook film!!
