</script><p> Invest in Mutual Fund: As the mutual funds are designed by investment companies to buy shares in different stocks and other securities, the mutual fund investor along with their ownership of shares of the mutual fund, have a restricted claim to ownership on few of the securities held by the mutual fund. Besides mutual funds provide the dual advantages of diversification and professional money management services to manage the money invested in the fund.

</script><p> hello blkvixon, <br>
 <br>
$100 is not alot of money as far as investing....especially if you&#039;re just starting out.  You most likely, won&#039;t see any big profits from it.  But who knows,  maybe you can flip it once or twice quickly.  Anyway, I don&#039;t advise mutual funds at all.  Those take forever to see any kind of profit.  You might want to invest in drips, until you can make bigger cash investments.  Start out with drips an din the meantime do some research on stocks,drips,stock market ,long-term investing and short term investing.  I don&#039;t know too much about long term investing.  I like fast money alot better. <br>
 <br>
hope I helped out a bit
        </p> I would say go for the mutual funds as they are more stable and less volatile than stocks. But take note that &quot;the rate of return on mutual funds is consistent but largely slow. If you are looking to collect quickly on your investment, then mutual funds are not your priority&quot;. <br>
 <br>
You might want to read up more on the pros and cons of mutual funds here: <br>

        </p> It is always good to prepare for the future -- so it is good to see you are trying.  However, $100 is not sufficient to invest in the stock market (more like $100,000 minimum) this is because you really need to diversify your money. <br>
 <br>
Mutual funds will do this.  You can start with $100 on some and then automatically have $25 - $100 sent on a monthly basis. <br>
 <br>
Another option is:  <br>

Hope this helps!
        </p> Go to the movies, have a meal out and enjoy your $100. Then do some research and attend some investment seminars. Then when you have more money you can invest.
        </p> Sorry, but $100 isn&#039;t enough to start investing in the market.  Use that to pay down your consumer debt or put it toward emergency cash savings.
        </p> i would start by reading the following books. <br>
1) the intelligent investor <br>
2) security analysis <br>
they would teach you how to invest.  <br>
 <br>
with just 100.00 i would look at DRIPS programs. most companies have them. you can look at dripcentral***.
