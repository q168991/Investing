<h1>Where should I invest 50k safely in something low-risk?</h1>
<div class="answer">I&amp;#39;m 28, I had my life savings in a regular savings account until a few years ago (I didn&amp;#39;t know any better), then in mid 05 my parents convinced me to go with their financial advisor and put it in mutual funds.

Those did OK but not great, and underperformed the market. Then I saw the Dow drop from 14k to 13k and got scared and sold, I guess I&amp;#39;m just not used to losing $1000+ in a day.

Right now I see a lot of negative opinions about the economy, so I want something SAFE and most of all I don&amp;#39;t want to lose money.

My local credit union offers CDs at 4.55% APY. Would this be a good idea? If so, how long should I get it for? This is what I&amp;#39;m leaning towards.

I expect I would do better with GLD or BRK.B, but it seems I have no risk tolerance. I got sick of checking my account every day and letting it affect me when things went down, I&amp;#39;d rather have smaller profits + peace of mind...<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Vanguards S&amp;P 500 fund would be perfect for you IMO. <br>
 <br>
I know its hard to watch your money disappear but it sounds like you&#039;re the kind of person who sells low and then ends up buying high ... don&#039;t feel too bad though about past mistakes cause many people do this. <br>
 <br>
CDs at 4.55% aren&#039;t breaking the cost of inflation, so you&#039;re losing money by putting it into CD&#039;s IMO.  Think about how much more food and gas costs then it used to...  <br>
 <br>
If you put 1000$ into a CD and a year later have 1050$ did you make any money if gas that would have cost you 1000$ a year earlier now costs 1070$ ? <br>
 <br>
Over time stock funds will always outperform any other type of investment.

</script><p> Your first option should be to fund fully a retirement account. If you do this, and you have extra cash, then one of the best things you can do is open a DRIP Plan. <br>
 <br>
Go to :  low-cost-stock-recommendations <br>
 <br>
*** <br>
 <br>
Click on the &quot;DRIP&#039;s&quot; Button on the Navigation Bar <br>
 <br>
These powerful investment plans are seldom talked about because brokers make very little money when they suggest them. Yet, they have proven to be one of the best, if not the best, long-term strategy on Wall Street.  <br>
 <br>
They are perfect for small investors, as well as big investors. They are safe and allow you to not care about whether the market is going up or down. They are a must for any serious investor. <br>
 <br>
If you decide you are interested in DRIP Plans, click on the advertisement on the same page &quot;$4 to purchase stocks&quot;. This will answer your next question, which is, How do I get started? and what is the least expensive way to get started? <br>
 <br>
I strongly recommend looking into it. They are great plans. <br>
 <br>
Good Luck
        </p> The money is safe in Cd&#039;s. no loss there. But returns are small. If you stay with Cd&#039;s spread them out buy a 6 month, 12, month, <br>
18 month , 2year and so on, in case you need the money. Then every 6 months you can renew them or cash them in without a penalty. In the mean time you can check around to see if you find anything else you feel comfortable with.
        </p> If the money is in for the longer term you should not worry too much . maybe switch your money into defensive stocks like utilities, food manufacture, food retail? and a bit more percentage into cash. Don&#039;t have any money in &#039;jam tomorrow&#039;  stocks
        </p> if you have no risk tolerance, CD would be good. But check first whether the return is higher than the inflation rate of your country.
        </p> Try ING Direct - they pay a good interest rate on a &quot;savings&quot; account.  This is much more liquid than a CD or time deposit.
        </p> i agree if u want to keep it for long term then stocks aren&#039;t bad! but safest is an bank FD.keep money for 13-15 months at an interest of 8.5 to 9%
        </p> you should invest your money in good script of mutual fund where risk is low and return is always high.
        </p> find some better stock to invest it in.
