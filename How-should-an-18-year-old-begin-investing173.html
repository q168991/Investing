<h1>How should an 18 year old begin investing?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am 18 years old, and a first year student in college.  I am looking to pursue a career in law enforcement when I graduate with my bachelors degree.  That aside, I am looking for some tips on how/if I could/should begin investing.

I'm not looking for big risk, like putting money into the stock market.  I only have about $1,000 in the bank currently, some of which will be gone after Christmas, the rest of school, etc. so I'm not looking to start right away.

However, this summer I plan to work and make at least a few thousand dollars, some of which I would like to begin investing.  I have heard of people just starting to buy CD's when they are 18 years old and working up to become millionaires that way, though that might be a little bit extreme.

My question is, how should an 18 year old student begin investing money?  Is it a good idea to start now, especially when the economy is doing so badly?  What is the best kind of investment to make at a young age, with a good yield over time but not too much of a risk?  Please give details, I have a basic knowledge of economics but I'm no economist by any means.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> The #1 rule of investing is NEVER invest in anything you don&#039;t understand.  You need to become familiar with the type of investments you will buy. <br>
A good place to start is money market funds.  These funds invest in very short term loans to major companies and carry very little risk.  In the long term (5 years or more) stock mutual funds have historically jhad the best returns of any investment.  That includes every major downturn in the history of the US stock market.

</script><p> Best time to buy is when the economy is doing badly, i.e. now. Buy low, sell high. People usually buy stocks/shares when things doing well and sell when market collapses, makes no sense. <br>
 <br>
Good yield, not too much risk? Sorry, but that&#039;s the trade off. You want more yield, you have to take more risk. People create fancy financial products with high yield, low risk, they are a con (last year is proof of this). Though &#039;diversification&#039; is good, ie don&#039;t put all your eggs in one basket. <br>
 <br>
If you want make good money (you want to be a millionaire!), invest small at the start in whatever you believe will do well. This way you will learn. However, dont get over-confidient if you do well or get down if you do badly, so much of investing is luck.   <br>
 <br>
Understand that there is a risk you will lose money if you invest in any sort of risky investment (pretty much anything, except gov. bonds, even then there is inflation risk). If you are not prepared to risk making a loss, put the money in a savings account.  If you are willing to take the risk, best of luck.
        </p> You should not invest at this time. I mean you can purchase CD&#039;s; however, banks usually just meat inflation on your money. Which means, the money that you have invested is worth the same amount when you get it out. The best thing for you to do is to safe it. If you want to invest in something... never get a loan. Loan rates are around 8 percent. That&#039;s a good return. Why pay someone else that great return? 
        </p> Start now when the economy is bad.  You are buying at the bottom of the market.  When the economy recovers you will be riding high. <br>
 <br>
Open an Account on Sharebuilder. Com. Then start buying stocks. <br>
Buy stocks into companies that you like MCdonald,s, Coke, Ford, and Clean Energy- CLNE. CLNE is one stock that is trading low and will go higher.  It has to do with alternative energy.
        </p> 1. Yes 2. E-Trade, Ameritrade, Scott Trade all seem fine as long as you can meet their minimum. 3. Start by buying shares of companies that you like. If you have an Apple computer or a Sprint phone, or use P&amp;G toothpaste, that is not a bad place to start. Or maybe you might feel more comfy with index funds. And since you are starting so young, I would suggest the more risky growth, small cap, or international funds. But please diversify, and do not get greedy.
        </p> CD&#039;s <br>
US I Bonds (not E Bonds) <br>
Open a brokerage account, start off ONLY with hi quality stocks, mutual funds. Invest conservatively your entire like, why would you want to be like us thousands of investors who just lost 25-30-$50,000. <br>
Real Estate Investment Trusts (REIT) <br>
Collectibles (Gold coins, rare stamps) <br>
 <br>
Read as much as you can from magazines and books and columns all free on the Internet, at the Library. I like Kiplinger, Money, Smart Money magazines. <br>
Stock brokers are liars, Wall Street is only interested in making money off us consumers by charging fees transaction costs
        </p> Buy smart right now and in 20- 25 years from now you should start to see some pretty good looking returns. Railroad, GE,and other needed Companies are worthwhile.
        </p> You may consider gold/silver (the real deal not futures).
        </p> Invest it in <br>
