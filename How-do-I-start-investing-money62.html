<h1>How do I start investing money?</h1>
<div class="answer">I&amp;#39;m a teenager who&amp;#39;s about finish up high school. I&amp;#39;ll be turning 18 soon and I&amp;#39;d like to start investing my money. The question is, how do I do it?

What would be the best course of action for a teenager who&amp;#39;s about to enter college with only a little bit of money and no experience? Should I put it in stocks and/or bonds? Which stocks/bonds would be most ideal to invest in at this current point? Should I put my money in something that will generate revenue very quickly, or over time? Any tips would help :)<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> If you have no experience in stocks - I would say keep away from individual stocks till the time you educate yourself in that area. If I were you I would invest in an index tracker fund. But don&#039;t expect to make quick profits - but over time you should do well (if history is any guide). <br>

 <br>
If you want to invest in individual stocks - do your own research. There is a compilation of resources from around the web at: http://***marketsuk***/ <br>

</script><p> If you have $1000-$2999, invest in the Vanguard Star Fund which is a mix of stocks and bonds and requires a minimum investment of $1000. If you have more money, you can invest in the Vanguard 500 Index Fund which broadly tracks the main US stock market. It requires a minimum $3000 investment.  If you have enough money I would spread it between the two funds.  I have money in both and have gotten very good returns (although they will occasionally lose money). I have a friend who (stupidly, sadly) does day trading and he hasn&#039;t even made a fraction of what I have made, and I just put the money in and forget about it. <br>
 <br>
Before you invest, you should put money in a savings account in case of emergency, though.
        </p> Check out investopedia*** if you are new to investing they have great video tutorials. Also you need to find a brokerage such as etrade*** which is a good one for all investing. <br>

In my opinion in these times of economic uncertainty safer investments such as corporate bonds are safer but can still return decent gain ( 5-10%) depending on risk.
        </p> i&#039;m 20 and make 35k /yrly. i took $500 - transfered to fidelity and split it into 1/3&#039;s.   <br>
 <br>
each 33.3% of my 500 was distributed to... <br>
 <br>
1.) CHK - 6 shares. at $21 per share. $0.08 dividened per quarter per share. <br>
2.) CLNE - 7 shares at $14 per share. no dividend.  <br>
3.) FB - 5 shares at 21 per share. no divs. <br>
 <br>
i will earn about $2.00 from CHK each year by annual dividend pay out. <br>
 <br>
if FB shares increase in price by 50-75%, I will sell them. If I buy 5 shares of fb stock at $21 per share it cost me $105 plus $7 in comission. If FB goes up to $60 a share (* hopefully *) i will have made a $188 profit. this is how investing works.  <br>
 <br>
natural gas is abundant right now. drilling is unprofitable at this point. it is wise to invest in distribution / processing of natural gas and natural gas liquids.  <br>
 <br>
also don&#039;t take others advice into 100% consideration. always. always. research. this is like gambling, except, a much better high and probable outcome.
