<h1>The Quickest, Best way to invest $1k for one year?</h1>
<div class="answer">I don&amp;#39;t have enough money for a car. I don&amp;#39;t have a Job because I don&amp;#39;t have the time (school). I have around $1k saved up. I will buy my First car next year. I need the quickest, most reliable and safest way to invest my $1k, and have around 5-10K by next year.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Hi there; <br>
I wanna show you one of the best and quickest way of investment; <br>
I have invested in an oil company named Viprol, its country of origin is Italy, the office is in london, and it has a very powerful buis. plan which you can earn 0.60-1% of your invested money(based on which plan you invest) daily!; which with 1000$, after a year you can achieve about 2390$ except the activites you may do! <br>
for more info visit: ***viprol*** <br>
 <br>
my email is: amir.s.2005@gmail***

</script><p> You&#039;re not going to find a real investment with that high of a yield in such a short time that is legitimate. There are many people on or off the Internet that will try to convince you that there is 500% to 1000% returns on investment, but those will all be scams!  <br>
 <br>
I&#039;m talking investment only, not a business. Depending on what type of business you have, there are people making 500%+ per year on there money. i.e. investing $100,000 in advertising to earn $500,000 from sales. <br>
 <br>
The best &quot;safe&quot; or &quot;lower risk&quot; high yield investments are going to be well below 20%. That&#039;s much less than $200 per year on your $1,000. <br>
 <br>
The best real high yield investment that I&#039;ve found so far is paying 17.64% Interest per year (paid monthly) or 19.14% per year with a ballon payment at years end. http://***investincarnotes*** <br>
 <br>
I know this isn&#039;t want you are looking for, but it&#039;s the reality of your situation.
        </p> I agree with No.1 comment.. Prices are really high these days.. However, aftersome time, you should consider: IBM, XOM, APPLE, CHEVRON, GS.. Varity of stocks is better, because at least you will minmize any risks.. Good Luck
        </p> You need to pay more attention in school if you honestly believe there is a way to &quot;safely&quot; turn $1,000 into $5,000-$10,000 in a year, silly goose!
