<div class="answer">to invest in. Are there books that you guys can reccomend to read in order to become a good investor and make a living off of it. Or would it be best to pay someone to tell me what to invest in. Where would I go to pay someone to tell me what to invest in. Can you guys reccomend companies. 

Also, Is it even possible to live off this amount over investing multiple times in a week. I am willing to put as many hours in as possible. I just want to make maybe the least amount would be 2000$ dollars a month maybe 1500$.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> 65k id by far not enough to live off... To earn a modest income out of investments youd need 1-2 million dollars at the minimum. <br>
 <br>
as for good advice what to invest in. you can either open up a brokerage account. do a crashcourse in investing and hobby a bit for yourself. or you could simply contact a bank to find a portfoliomanager to do it for you (against a small fee ofcourse.) <br>
 <br>
dont trust any of the advertisements on here. theyre mostly scams. forex trading is NOT for beginners. infact its not even for the smalltime investor. bank&#039;s treasuries have a hard time making money on forex.
