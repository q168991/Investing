<h1>Anybody who have read/studied Charles Mizrahi book Getting Started in Value Investing?</h1>
<div class="answer">I think it&amp;#39;s a great book but have a question to those who read it. On page 136 of the book he mentioned that when he applied the stocks screen of Value Line Investment Survey, he said &amp;quot;we are now left with 152 companies&amp;quot;. On page 137 table 9.5 he listed some companies(I think about 35 companies only) that made that screen.

Would you be kind enough to email me the other companies in that filter please? I&amp;#39;d appreciate it lot. By the way, I don&amp;#39;t have any membership account in Value Line.

I emailed him but didn&amp;#39;t get any response so far. Thanks very much<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
