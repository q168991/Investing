<h1>How should I invest, long-term?</h1>
<div class="answer">I&amp;#39;m looking for advice on how to invest for the long-term.  I&amp;#39;ve been reading about investing for a while and have a strategy in mind but would like to know if it&amp;#39;s a solid plan.  I&amp;#39;m 24, military enlisted, and have invested the maximum allowed in a Roth IRA for the last 3 years, in index funds (VFINX, NAESX, and VGTSX).  I have also been investing approximately $3 - $5K in the Thrift Savings Plan (government employees 401k) in a Lifecycle fund, or target retirement fund, for 3 years.  I&amp;#39;ll have my car paid off and $20K in an easily accessible high yield savings account before the end of 2011, with no bills thereafter.  At that point I&amp;#39;ll have at least $1K a month to invest in the stock market.  I would like to have a buy-and-hold strategy and I am wondering if dollar-cost-averaging about 10 dividend paying stocks, with a long history of increasing dividends (KO, JNJ, MSFT) would be a smart investment strategy.  I don&amp;#39;t want to have to actively manage the account, although I know I would have to adjust my holdings once in a while, and I would make safer investments as I get closer to retirement.  I would also have about $6K a year to play around with in the stock market or to add to my savings.

Is $5K in my Roth IRA, $3 - $5K in my TSP, $12K in dividend paying stocks and $6K to play around with each year a sound approach or am I on the wrong track?  I don&amp;#39;t really spend any of my money and I want to have a nice retirement nest egg so any advice would be appreciated.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> You have started at a younger age than most people.  You have also found the best mutual fund company in Vanguard.  Congrats on a terrific start investing. <br>
 <br>
Individual stocks are a fine idea if you educate yourself to do so effectively.  A few excellent books; two easy, one more challenging but an absolute classic: <br>
 <br>
One Up On Wall Street - Peter Lynch <br>
A Random Walk Down Wall Street - Burton Malkiel <br>
The Intelligent Investor - Benjamin Graham <br>
 <br>
You might also diversify your portfolio by adding allocations to a few new areas. <br>
 <br>
International stocks, including Emerging Markets (Vanguard Total Intl) <br>
Real Estate - Vanguard has a REIT fund <br>
Commodities (for inflation protection) - Consider VGPMX

</script><p> You seem to be quite sophisticated in this matter... I definitely think what you posted works.  You say you don&#039;t spend any of your money... my question is, how sad would you be if you lost a big chunk of it?  This is learning how risk-averse you are. <br>
 <br>
MSFT does have a history of paying dividends, but this does not guard you against drop in principal.  It is down a bit now anyway, but I don&#039;t see anything just obviously GREAT going on there, either.  Don&#039;t know if that&#039;s going to change. <br>
 <br>
If I were you, I&#039;d dabble in more risky transactions.  You might dabble in options... if you do, then don&#039;t be sad if you lose money. <br>
 <br>
But for instance, with $6K, you could buy some contracts.  You might choose to investigate and bet that something will go up or go down.  But make sure that you are hedged your risk.   <br>
 <br>
The stock market (the MARKET in general) is a giant garage sale now.  If I were you, I wouldn&#039;t fear the risk... there is an old saying for entrepreneurs.. or a strategy, if you will... buy 25 knowing that 20 are going to lose money.  The five that make money will more than pay for the ones that lose.  At 24, if you lost everything you have, you are not gonna be that worse off for it.  Just make sure that you keep whatever you MIGHT need in the short-term in a low-risk or riskless investment.   <br>
 <br>
Roth&#039;s are the greatest thing now, but you have to keep it in there for five years before you can touch it.  Keep a rainy-day fund and invest vigorously.   <br>
 <br>
For instance, you might buy an option to buy BP stock.  :)  --- you might pay $2k today and never exercise it... meaning you lose that investment.  But if you exercise that option when BP is up next year (which it probably will be... lol), then you&#039;ll be better off for it.  I am not advising you do this with BP.  But, it&#039;s the type of risky investment that will get you somewhere quicker. <br>
 <br>
GM is about to, or just has had, the biggest IPO in US history.  Sounds like it might be overpriced, maybe?  You might bet against it over the next year.  Just do it in options.  Don&#039;t buy the stock. <br>
 <br>
Investigate all of this.  Keep your roth, your thrift.. get you some income funds (dividend stocks or dividend mutual funds)... and then go casino-style at the rest.  Your nest egg is not going to rise fast enough at .55% interest.  and you know this.
        </p> First I commend you on starting so early in life.  It will make a big difference.  Second, thank you for your service!!  Now, you can not really dollar cost average into individual stocks as the prices may not let you buy even number of shares (which you need to do with stocks).  You can however dollar cost average into a mutual fund of blue-chip stocks holding the equities you mentioned.  In addition, a fund allows more easily adding to principle which is as sound an investment strategy as ever invented.  The $6k to &quot;play around&quot; with might be better suited to buy individual stock which are appealing to you based on company fundamentals at that time. <br>
As for an &quot;approach&quot;, I admire your savings mentality.  I would recommend adding to the ROTH as you can, redirect the TSP to an aggressive equities account, target date or Life Cycle funds are not a great  place if you are willing to learn how to save for retirement.  They are for the financially challenged and you are clearly not that.  Better to use a common stock fund or domestic stock fund split with an international component.  Does the TSP offer those things?  Its been a while since I worked with a gov&#039;t employee.  One more thing.  Although you are interested in saving for retirement, I would strongly consider putting money away in a second (not your normal) bank.  Accumulate 4-5 months of expenses in this 2nd bank.  This is to cover the surprises that life throws at you.  Without it, you will be tapping retirement accounts and that can be prohibitively expensive in taxes and penalties.
        </p> Investing is one of the best and most important ways you can save money for the future.In long term investment, you are giving your money the time it needs to work for you behind the scenes until you&#039;re ready to start cashing in on your accomplishments. You must try to consider to understand that even though long-term investing is far safer financially than short-term investing, there is still the chance that you will lose money. The risks are much lower, especially when you choose less-volatile mutual funds or investment opportunities, but they are still there. Markets and investment values will fluctuate up and down, and unless you&#039;ve made unsound investments, your chances of seeing profits are fairly good with long-term investments.
