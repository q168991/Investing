I&amp;#39;m taking a personal finance class and I have no answer for this question<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Investing in human capital basically means hiring good people, or spending money to train existing staff, so that they do their jobs better. <br>
 <br>
Good people work better than bad people (by definition).  They produce more, make more sales, design better products, handle client inquiries and complaints better, etc.   <br>
 <br>
Not only is it a good idea to invest prudently in the overall education of your staff, it is also important to avoid destroying human capital in the name of &quot;cutting expenses&quot;.   I saw US banks do a lot of this throughout the 90&#039;s and early 2000&#039;s.   They gutted their processing centers and customer service centers.  These were seen as &quot;cost centers&quot;.  What people failed to see is that a lot of the people they laid off had a lot of knowledge that was lost in the process.  Now try calling the 800 number at JPM Chase (for example) and try to get a complex question resolved.  Odds are you will be talking to an ignorant underpaid slob who is being forced to read off a script.  You will be lucky if he even tries to understand what the problem is, much less attempts a meaningful resolution.  This is the result of under-investment in human capital. <br>
 <br>
Excuse the rant, I hope it gives you some idea of how to approach the question.

</script><p> Most companies when times turn difficult de-invest in human capital.  It is a relatively painless way for management to match their cost structure to there income structure.  They do not generally invest in human capital until they think that they need to do so or until some department head convinces his/her boss that it would be advantageous to do so. There has been a good deal of de-investing going on lately.
        </p> Capital are machines. You can&#039;t buy humans, therefore your question is out of order. There is no human capital. You don&#039;t invest in humans. You only hire them. They are employees who may have profit sharing plans or be in a union.
