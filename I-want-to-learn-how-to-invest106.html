</script><p> The less money you have, the more careful you have to be, so it&#039;s critical that you avoid mistakes.  Try to keep your learning curve as simple as possible for the first year.  You could set up an account for practice at ***money.cnn*** before you invest for real.  Remember, there are tens of thousands of professionals out there doing this for a living, so give yourself a good foundation.  In addition to &quot;Joy of Stock Market Investing,&quot; read Charles Ellis, &quot;Winning the Loser&#039;s Game.&quot;  Try to stay away from books that promote a specific technique until you&#039;re comfortable with the fundamentals.
        </p> First.  Learn something about investing.  Investing for Dummies is one source, as is Personal Finance for Dummies.  Neither book is terribly indepth, but they both do a good job of explaining the concepts for the novice. <br>
 <br>
Second, get to Vanguard***, and look at their personal investment site.  They have an outstanding &quot;university&quot; for new investors.  I have out several links below to get you started. <br>
 <br>
Best of luck
        </p> Every time I watch Suze Orman I learn something new. I like her books.. the best is her biggest one.. something about the &quot;road to wealth&quot;.. has info on just about everything.  <br>
I wasn&#039;t a beginner but I learned alot in just the 3 days I&#039;ve had it.
        </p> Read &quot;Investing For Dummies.&quot;  A great place to begin.
        </p> Get an online brokerage account.  Put your money in there and invest it.
        </p> you can mail me jihenebensaad@yahoo*** i am manager in royal index i can give you a free training online and after you can start to earn money
