<h1>Which factors should one consider while choosing a fund for investing?</h1>
<div class="answer">While choosing a specific fund out of many in a category (say large cap) which factors out of the following should one give importance and why? (please explain since I am new in this area and trying to understand)

past performance (1/3/5years), risk level, rating (no of stars), expense ratio, P/E, alpha, beta, standard deviation, NAV, portfolio composition, experience of fund manager, asset under management (aum) etc, or any other factor(s)?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> This is my person opinion, but I think it is valid.   The performance figures are generally what one considers first, next is how long the current manager has been managing the fund.  If it has not been at least 5 years forget it.  Assets under management are a consideration.  The larger a fund is the more difficult it is to manage--. exponentially.  A fund over say $2 billion is extremely difficult.  A lot is made of the expense ratio these days.  Generally though my idea is that if a fund with a higher expense ratio is outperforming one with a lower expense ratio, why on earth would I want to invest in the one with the lower expense ratio.  You did not mention front end load.  Avoid funds with front end loads unless they are really top notch performers.  Number of stars allow you to weed out all the under performers without having to weed through a bunch of weeds.  4 and 5 star funds are a beginning.  <br>

I am not familiar with the tax situation in India, but generally a fund that churns its portfolio often is going to have greater capital gains than one that does less frequently.  Think after tax profits.
