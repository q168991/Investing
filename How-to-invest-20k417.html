</script><p> Don&#039;t go for stocks. Since the stock market is not going so well, overseas investments would be the best choice. <br>
 <br>
Starting a small business would be the way to go if you have time. <br>
Alternatively try to invest in someones business. You may receive up to 20% guaranteed interest a year. You will not get such high guaranteed returns on stocks, mutual funds, bonds or CD&#039;s. <br>
If you invest $10,000 at 20% annual interest rate, you will get back $12,000 in 1 year. I run my own business and my net profit is over 5% a month. <br>
 <br>
Email me at investment4us@hotmail*** and I&#039;ll give you a valuable advice if you are serious about investing. Please don&#039;t forget to mention your question and  screenname on Y.A. <br>
Best of luck!
        </p> Fixed rate bond. Interest rates on savings accounts are high at the moment (banks are trying to attract savings to shore up balance sheets). It is unusual to have rates two full points higher than the BOE base rate and this certainly won&#039;t last. Inflationary pressures are reducing and there could well be a base rate cut in the next month or two. I would lock in now - there are good rates at Kaupthing Edge, ICICI Bank, Anglo Irish and Birmingham Midshires. There are others too, giving a return of 7% or more (gross). You don&#039;t say if you are a tax payer and what rate - that could affect your decision.
        </p> I had the same problem as you have. <br>
I had a good amount of money, but didn&#039;t knew where to invest it. <br>
So I looked around for something that gave me a great return towards a low risk. <br>
And the only thing I could find was a mannaged account. <br>
Here you can follow up my results of every day: <br>
http://my-robottrader.blogspot***/ <br>
 <br>
I&#039;m verry excited because I already have 40% ROI in one month and a half. <br>
My moneymannager is giving me great support, and answer all of my questions almost immediatly. <br>
Annyway feel free to contact me (adress on my blog) and I&#039;ll bring you in direct contact with my money mannager.
        </p> TNE 5k, the merger with BRP should be announced any day giving you an easy 30% pop <br>
 <br>
HCSG nations leading healthcare linen provider +400% gain never sold a share.  Safe boring nice dividend <br>
 <br>
RSG safe boring undervalued garbage play just announced great earnings  <br>
 <br>
OXY highest free cash yield of any major oil company <br>
 <br>
ATVI still waiting on the merger data in the first Q but should reach mid 30s by summer <br>
 <br>
WU cash machine 1.5 billion in free cash should earn another 800 million this year.   <br>
 <br>
AVP- Avon just announed 17% sales growth that&#039;s three Q&#039;s in a row with double dig growth watch it hit $50 <br>
 <br>
Good luck. <br>
 <br>
I&#039;m long all these stocks
        </p> Short the stock market.  You make money if the market goes down.  You can easily do it by buying an &quot;inverse index fund&quot;.  Profunds and Rydex has some. <br>
 <br>
Another option is a 3 month CD.
        </p> Consider the Vanguard Prime Money Market Fund with a current compound yield of ~4.25%  APY.  <br>

  <br>
If you are in a high tax bracket you may prefer their tax exempt money market funds:   <br>

  <br>
Sometimes other institutions will have a higher teaser rate, but Vanguard tends to have the highest yields I&#039;ve found over the long run.  (Vanguard money markets are not FDIC insured, however.)  <br>
  <br>
Article on teaser rates:   <br>

  <br>
Bankrate*** provides links to CD&#039;s with high interest rates as well as high interest rate banks. <br>

 <br>
  <br>
  <br>
ING and HSBC often have rates close to Vanguard, and most of their products are FDIC insured.    You can check these at the following links:  <br>

        </p> You might consider US Govt Municipal Bonds as they were, I am not sure if they still are, paying about 4.65% tax free.  <br>
 <br>
I also do not know what the shortest time frame is you can purchase for them. But a 4.65% no tax rate is superior to what else is on the market.  <br>
 <br>
It might be a good idea to check into it
