</script><p> Well, you got a lot of advice here, but not one person asked you what your timeframe is. If you intend to grow that money, then use it for something ( say, college or graduate school, , house downpayment, large purchase like a fabulous vacation or new car, then a mutual fund may not be a good idea. That&#039;s because mutual funds work best as long term investments-10, 20, 30 years or more. They do fluctuate in the short term ( some are down 10% or more this year) so you can actually lose some of your principal if you have to pull it out during a downturn (bear market). The best thing for you to do is have a meeting at a brokerage, like Schwab, or TD Ameritrade. You can actually get professional help making your decision. You will be asked about your risk appetite ( at 22 it pays to be a little aggressive, if you can live with the fluctuations--sometimes it is drastic) and goals for your savings. It&#039;s a wonderful idea. If you can&#039;t stand risk, then you can buy I-Bonds at the bank, which are inflation protected. Start reading, and learn all you can. Some good websites include ***bloomberg***, Yahoo Finance, ***ibd*** (investors business daily), Vanguard, Fidelity--they all have websites. And, of course, your public library has plenty of material about how to get started. <br>
Best of luck to you! I think it&#039;s great that you are mindful of your future, and want to save and invest. Start with a call to a brokerage and talk to a broker. He/She will be happy to help you get started.

</script><p> 80% of traditional mutual funds don&#039;t beat the SP500 over the long term.  You can do two things though.  One is to buy an ETF that tracks something like the SP 500 (in this case it would be SPY).  Read articals against mutual funds (and articals debating traditional mutual funds vs ETFs) and if you still want to get into a mutual fund, look at the fees while shopping.  <br>
 <br>
There are also indexes you can buy with sometimes even lower fees, but genrally one needs a few thousand dollars to buy one (you may need enough).  For instance the SP500 really is an index that is sold as one. Russell 2000 is another Index that you can buy. Wilshire 5000 allows you to buy an index that covers every stock in the whole NYSE. <br>
 <br>
As far as buying stock, you generally want to buy during a downturn.  there are  stories of millionares turned billionares when they bought stock during the Great Depression.  Although you probably won&#039;t get that lucky with $2,000, but chances are you will be doing something &quot;for free.&quot;  Let&#039;s say you spend $40 a month for an internet connection for 30 years.  You will have spent $14,400.  At an average 9% compound a year for 30 years, you will have $26,500.  So after taxes and the difference of $14,400 you will probably get your $2,000 back.  Hence you got your internet connection for free by letting the $2,000 sit.
        </p> Mutual Funds are good investment vehicles, particularly for  those with little investment experience.  But one of the things to consider is the brokerage company selling the Fund will make most of the profit from your investment.  You actually get very little profit for what you invest.  But it&#039;s still fairly safe, in that you most likely will make some profit.  However, consider some of the one line brokerage companies, actually you can visit or call them.  Many will help pick a Fund, you control the investment, and you make all the profit.
        </p> I would invest in Fidelity fund with a focus on domestic U.S. growth stocks.   In the alternative, I would go with a Dodge and Cox fund, and last but not least a fund managed by Ken Heebner.  Mr. Heebner has a great understanding of international and domestic opportunity.   I buy the stocks in his funds.  I sleep well with the feeling that Mr. Heebner &quot;has my back.&quot;   Buy through a discount broker.  As Schwab ads often point out &quot;friendship is not enough&quot; on which to base a brokerage relationship.   Disclaimer:  I dont own any mutual funds and would advise you put your fund in an IRA to simplify your tax return.  Good luck and much prosperity to you.
        </p> There are lot&#039;s of great options. <br>
The best way to invest $2000 is to invest in someone&#039;s business. I have invested in my friend&#039;s small business and now I am getting guaranteed 40% annual interest.  <br>
 <br>
I wish you success!
        </p> Yes, mutual funds are still your best choice for &#039;safe returns&#039; given volatility in the stock / real state markets. Go for equity schemes and maybe a sector fund as well.
        </p> I personally would go with Index Equity Funds in the US. They&#039;re the best option to tide over market volatility but still give you decent returns to beat inflation.
        </p> a lot of volatility in the markets right now play it safe through a guaranteed return investment for the short term and when the volatility goes away at least relatively then dive into equity.
        </p> Try an oil and gas mutual fund. Seems like that&#039;s the only thing making any money these days.
