Shayla, it sounds like you have not invested in the past. Don&#039;t go for stocks if you know nothing about stocks. <br>
 <br>
There are many good ways to make money.  <br>
Since the stock market is not going so well, overseas investments would be the best choice. <br>
 <br>
Starting a small business would be the way to go if you have time. <br>
Alternatively try to invest in someones business. You may receive up to 20% guaranteed interest a year. You will not get such high returns on stocks, mutual funds, bonds or CD&#039;s.  <br>
If you invest $10,000 at 20% annual interest rate, you will get back $24,883.20 in 5 years. I run my own business and my net profit is over 5% a month. <br>
 <br>
Some of the European banks are offering 7% to 14% annual interest rate (3-5 years deposits). <br>
 <br>
Email me at   investment4us@hotmail*** and I&#039;ll give you a valuable advice if you are serious about investing. Please don&#039;t forget to mention your nickname and question at Y.A. <br>
 <br>
Best of luck!
        </p> I would reccommend you not to invest in stocks. <br>

I don&#039;t like stocks. I have invested in small business. Now I am earning 2% income monthly (24% annually). I&#039;m sure I&#039;ll double my money in 3-4 years.
        </p> You should invest in an index fund. It follows which ever market you select such as the S&amp;P500. Take it out at a discount brokerage firm so you pay a lower fee. Most stock funds don&#039;t beat the market. If they do then there&#039;s a higher management fee and you end up around what the market makes anyways.
        </p> Ehm.. <br>
I&#039;ve been trading the market for just a few months. My cousin actually told me about this website ( http://pennystocks.toptips.org ) and I signed up immediately after. This is my honest review about their method. I&#039;m not someone who has a lot of time to be researching for ideas because I work many hours. they made it incredibly easy for me to make money in the market. Their reports are easy to read and follow. I&#039;ve tracked most of the stock ideas that I&#039;ve received in my e-mail from them and MANY have seen some nice gains after their announcements. I&#039;ve made a nice profit (55% return on my investment on one, and 112% on the other!) on a couple of suggestions he&#039;s given and plan to start trading his ideas a lot more.  <br>

        </p> it would be best to by a fund which is a collection of stocks managed by a professional.  you can by into an industry fund or pick a generic one.  Either way your $$ is working while you learn how to invest.
        </p> 1
        </p> research biomedical companies, pick the biggest player and go with it. Otherwise go with any company that&#039;s heavily invested in alternative fuels.  <br>
 <br>
If 10 000 is not throw away cash, invest it in an RRSP type investment, something long term and guaranteed.

i have attended a lot of seminars, read counless books on forex trading and it all cost me thousands of dollars. the worst thing was i blew up my first account. after that i opened another account and the same thing happened again. i started to wonder why i couldn,t make any money in forex trading. at first i thought i knew everything about trading. finally i found that the main problem i have was i did not have the right mental in trading. as we know that psychology has great impact on our trading result. apart from psychology issue, there is another problem that we have to address. they are money management, market analysis, and entry/exit rules. to me money management is important in trading. i opened another account and start to trade profitably after i learnt from my past mistake. i don&#039;t trade emotionally anymore.  <br>
if you are serious about trading you need to address your weakness and try to fix it. no forex guru can make you Professional trader unless you want to learn from your mistake.
