<h1>Do you think it&#039;s ok to start investing in stocks and bonds? I want to plan for retirement.?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am 32 years old.  I want to start planning for retirement.  I hear all the bad news about the stock market.  What do you think about investing in stocks, bonds or mutual funds for retirement?  What about annuities?  I&amp;#39;m very green with investing terminology and concepts so I&amp;#39;m open to suggestions.  Thanks.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> If you&#039;re not retired and you&#039;re working then it&#039;s a good time to be investing in stocks and bonds.   As long as you have a balanced portfolio, you can gain from the declines in the market by rebalancing so a market downturn is no reason to stop investing.   Indeed when people stop during the difficult times, they make their recovery all the more difficult. <br>
 <br>
An example of rebalancing would be if you had a $1,000 portfolio and you had a balance target of 50% in stocks and 50% in cash therefore you have $500 stocks and $500 cash.   Let&#039;s say the stocks dropped in half, you now have $250 stocks and $500 cash so you rebalance by purchasing $125 in stocks giving you $375 stocks and $375 cash.   Let&#039;s say the stocks goes back to it&#039;s original price, you then have $750 stocks and $375 cash for a portfolio value of $1,125 all while the stock price is essentially unchanged.   Similarly had the stock doubled and then halved, you would&#039;ve gone from $500/$500 to $1,000/$500 rebalanced to $750/$750 and dropped to $375/$750 for a portfolio of $1,125.   Frequent rebalancing results in buying low and selling high but due to the commission costs, you often only rebalance once a year. <br>
 <br>
Now Ben Graham said to invest 45% in equity ( stock ) and 55% in bonds.   Markowitz said the lowest risk is 25% equity, 75% bonds which is safer than 100% bonds and that 50/50 has the same risks as 100% bonds but much better returns.   Claude Shannon at MIT did a mathematical proof that 50/50 was the optimal so why do they say to be aggressive when young and offer aggressive funds of 80% equity or more?   Ben Graham said to never go below 25% equity and never above 80% equity so many people follow the advice of investing 100 - their age in percent in equity thereby moving from 80% to 25% equity in a straight line but why?   Your continued contribution is why, you are contributing a set sum from your paycheck each and every month, this cash flow is like the payments from a bond so you in fact already have a bond investment as secure as your job for as long as you contribute to your investment.   You can even calculate it&#039;s value if you have a suitable discount rate; as you can&#039;t trade in your job for cash, that discount rate should at least be equivalent to the return of your investments, currently we would expect a return of 5.4% per annum from stock market investments so using that as a discount rate, putting $466.66 per month ( maxing out your IRA or TFSA if you&#039;re Canadian ) from the age of 32 till you&#039;re 60 would be the same as having $466.66 * ( 1 - 1 / 1.054^28 ) / ( 1 - 1 / 1.054^( 1 / 12 ) ) = $82,238.96 so you can invest more aggressively in equity before you reach the 50% equity and 50% bonds mark if you consider your continued contributions as money invested in a bond.   However your rebalancing would be limited to the contributions themselves so you can only take so much advantage of a down market which normally isn&#039;t bad as you would achieve the ideal 50/50 market faster by investing all equity but these are times when a downturn is quite possible so it may be better to go with Ben Graham&#039;s 80% equity till you&#039;re balanced. <br>
 <br>
You can achieve a balanced portfolio by investing in an appropriate mutual fund, investing in a combination of a low fee index fund ( all equity ) and a low fee bond fund, or selecting your own investments.   Annuities are often offered by insurance companies and have an insurance premium involved so you are paying for a benefit you hope never to collect.   It is wise to have an emergency fund against the unknown so as not to make a bad financial decision but an insurance policy is an expensive and qualified way to do it.

</script><p> It would be a good plan to avoid annuities.  They have a very bad reputation that is well deserved.  I am retired and I did plan for my retirement by investing in stocks and bonds. If you have earned income a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA is the way to begin.  You can put up to $5000 a year into one.  A traditional IRA has the advantage that you do not pay taxes on the money you put in but you do have to pay taxes on everything that you take out.  A Roth IRA requires that you pay taxes on what you put in but do not pay taxes on the amount taken out.  Personally, I prefer the Roth IRA but from the analysis that I have done I can really not see any distinct advantage of one over the other under current tax law.  Not all of your investments should be within an IRA.  Some--at least 1/2--should be outside so you can have access to the money if the need arises. You do not have access to funds in an IRA without penalty until you are 59.5.
        </p> One of the basic rewards of stock investing is the chance of a huge returns. The value of stocks raises as company grow large. The possibility of profit is very high because of the trend of the market to have an upward pattern if an investor chose the right companies to buy stocks from. In a shorter period time he may gain profit more if the investor traded constantly. Additional benefit of investing in stocks is accessibility. At this point, there are many stocks existed in the market. With appropriate analysis and research of the stocks and the companies that issued them via alpha.forcastix***, anyone with enough capital can get an ownership of stocks. <br>
 <br>
Other than that, stocks traded in the market also have better liquidity than other securities offered. It can be easily changed into cash by selling the equities with various traders in the market. Lastly, investing in stocks minimizes the rate of taxes from capital profits.
