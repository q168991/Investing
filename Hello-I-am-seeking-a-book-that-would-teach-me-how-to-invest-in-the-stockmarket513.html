        </p> We always recommend &quot;The Craft of Investing&quot; by John Train.  It is both simple to read and elegantly written.  It also will easily fit in your book bag in paperback form.  You can likely find it at Amazon for a very reasonable price.  Members of our staff have worked for Mr. Train and he is a truly gifted writer and investor.  You will come away with a sound grasp of the basics in all fundamental areas of investing. <br>
 <br>
Best of success to you in your investment education efforts.
        </p> That is very smart of you to learn how to invest. Some people would jump in without a clue and lose a lot of money. There are plenty of free information on the internet.
        </p> I have two recommendations: <br>
 <br>
Beating the Street by Peter Lynch <br>
http://***amazon***/Beating-Street-Peter-Lynch/dp/0671891634/ref=sr_1_4?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1246568211&amp;sr=8-4 <br>
and  <br>
 <br>
The Little Book of Value Investing by Christopher Browne <br>
http://***amazon***/s/ref=nb_ss_b_0_16?url=search-alias%3Dstripbooks&amp;field-keywords=little+book+of+value+investing&amp;sprefix=little+book+of+v <br>
 <br>
They would probably be both in your local library.
