<h1>I want to invest my money?</h1>
<div class="answer">i am a student and have managed to save quite a bit of my pocket money apart 
from working in 1-2 odd jobs. i want to invest my money suitably now.
is investing in shares a good idea? the problem is, i don&amp;#39;t get much time during my academic year and hence maintaining of the account might get difficult.how often will i have to monitor it?

</script><p> Your are on the right path. <br>
 <br>
It&#039;s good to hear that you are planning for the future. Very few do that. <br>
 <br>
Firstly, you need to decide if you want to invest for short term or long term. <br>
 <br>
This will help you to choose between investment products. <br>

Alternatively you can look at my site; <br>

</script><p> Good luck to you. Investing a sizable sum in stocks can be nerve wracking and unproductive if you&#039;ve  <br>
guessed wrong.  Even checking progress or loss frequently doesn&#039;t help matters. I much suspect the average investor loses money, same as gamblers in Vegas.  I think you should put the money in &quot;safe&quot;  <br>
investments like CDs or whatever else has a guaranteed return. Stay away from mutual funds that are <br>
followed by a letter, they&#039;re often referred to as xyz funds, Prudential has them and if a broker offers you such funds, it&#039;s a tip off that he doesn&#039;t care about you. . xyz funds provide a hefty commission to the broker who recommends them to you and the xyz type of  funds suck. With this terrible economy, I think now you should most concentrate on preserving what you&#039;ve saved. You might take a small portion and invest in a mutual fund or individual stocks, if you want to accept some risk. Do some simple research using a search-engine on the internet, or books. Find out what investments are guaranteed, even though the returns may be small.
        </p> Put your money in a regular savings account (possibly some in 1 yr CD&#039;s) then invest in yourself (ie, your education.)  Money works for you by letting you not stress over finances so you can concentrate on your studies.  When you get a real job and get settled in life you can worry about investing; and that would be a house purchase where you plan on being employed a long time.  Pocket money can disappear over night.  And looking forward, you may need a new suit for job interviews, and money for first and last on a new apartment, transportation, etc for your first job.  No need to take financial risks at this time.
        </p> would need a bit more detail.  ow much money?  What is your timeframe? <br>
 <br>
If you want to invest money for more than 5 years, then stocks are probably a good choice.  You would eant to invest in a good quality mutual fund with a long-term track record.  Idealy, you would invest a steady amount every month (dollar cost averaging). <br>
 <br>
Unless you have a minimum of $1,000 (and $5,000 is more reasonable) then you should probably stay away from stocks.
        </p> You should talk to a professional financial adviser, either through your bank or a firm like Edward Jones (I don&#039;t know if they exist in the US or not...) <br>
 <br>
There are several different ways to invest money, and an adviser can help you decide which is best for you. The stock market yields the highest returns, but it also has the highest risk (the companies you invest in might die, and then you lose your investment).
        </p> It is healthy to invest money in shares in companies with a good name, like Godrej India, Siemens international, etc. because, you are willing to let others use your money to build up the economy, and in return, you will share the divident of 10% to 20% per year, and you will get a capital gain if you sell your share in times of need, like buying a house, or a ceremony. <br>
Some people use the same government instrument to gamble.  This makes everyone lose. They tend to drink alcohol, and can die of heart attack. <br>
I too invest for my children&#039;s education, and expect to get a return of 2 million rupees soon, but even if this does not materialize, the money is insured by HDFC SLIC (housing and development funding corporation), so I will not lose my money, and so I am not gambling with my life, or the life of my children. <br>
I hope, this will orient you.
        </p> The Best Invt Idea according to me is.... <br>
 <br>
Mutual Funds through SIP route which generally start at a meagre Rs. 100 per month and over a long period of time will fetch the maximum returns. <br>
 <br>
Thank You
        </p> Precious metals are always a safe investment, and you won&#039;t have to pay taxes when you sell them either.
        </p> you should look out for etfs
