<h1>Good ways to start investing money?</h1>
<div class="answer">I&amp;#39;m 19 and a Pre-Business student in college. I was wondering what are some good ways to start investing money with a small about (Around $1,000)? Aside from very safe bets with lower returns (such as CDs), what are some good choices for quick returns without a lot of risk? Where to begin investing in stocks? Are there any websites that let you trade for very cheap? Is day-trading a good idea? I am a very basic beginner, so any help would be great. I&amp;#39;d prefer short-term cash return (definately less than a year). Any advice is much appreciated. Thanks<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> I would suggest mutual funds as a starting point. You can generate a greater return than banks and CDs. Your money is liquid an d easily accessible. And the fact that a mutual fund diversifies your investment dollars would expose you to less risk than taking a shot at an individual stock.

</script><p> Putting money into a 401K doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;re doing it correctly. My vote is to not do a thing until you learn the basics. The most logical place to start is Stock Mutual Funds. Get some basic books on Mutual Funds (at least 2-3). This is not going to be painful. In addition also read 2-3 books on stock investing. Then... you&#039;ll be ready to choose a broker or no load, low fee Mutual Fund company. I&#039;m not a big fan of eTrade.... but you could do worse. Check out TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab &amp; Fidelity.
        </p> the stock market is a great place do invest a small amount like that. In particular small cap stocks that are a safe bet with the right research. If you do some research you can double or triple your money very quickly with small cap stocks. Ranging from around $1- $5 I am using http://goldenbullpicks*** check them out you will be impressed! and remember to do your own research.
        </p> Invest in Mutual Fund; As the mutual funds are designed by investment companies to buy shares in different stocks and other securities, the mutual fund investor along with their ownership of shares of the mutual fund, have a restricted claim to ownership on few of the securities held by the mutual fund. Besides mutual funds provide the dual advantages of diversification and professional money management services to manage the money invested in the fund. <br>

        </p> Hello, <br>
                        As Far as i know  <br>
                         <br>
Delivery Trading <br>
----------------------- <br>
You have to invest only 5% of Your total cash you are having.It can be under that.You have to spread your investment  in different sectors like Realestate,Cement,Power e.tc.Dont wait for more profit.Once you have a considerable amount book your profits. <br>
 <br>
Day Trading <br>
----------------- <br>
 <br>
You can do day trading also  <br>
 <br>
Lets say you have 10 shares of A purchased at a price of  100 per share in Delivery trading.Now The Price of share goes up to 110.You have a profit of  100(10 *10). Now when you sell the share at 110 per share you will be getting margin to Day trade.Buy share B with that margin(Dont ever sell/short).Lets say  Now You Bought 10 shares of  B at the rate of 50 per share with that margin. <br>
 <br>
a) <br>
If The Price of share B goes up to 55 You can sell it and close the trade.You will get a profit of 5 Per share.Total profit 50(5*10).You will still have Your 5% Money to buy again. <br>
b) <br>
If the price of share B goes down to 45.In this case the price of share You sold at 110 in Delivery trading will also go down(general assumption).Lets say it goes down to 100.Yo have made a loss of 5  per share  in share B(i.e Total loss 50 ) .You are in a gain of 10 per share in share A(i.e Total gain 100).Now Your net profit is 50.You Have to  Sell share B First and then buy share A to get profit of 50. <br>
 <br>
You will still have your 10 shares  A at Price of 100 in delivery in your account.  <br>
 <br>
You cannot close your Delivery position before closing your day trade position because you are day trading with only your delivery margin. <br>
 <br>
Lastly its your hard earned money so be careful.You have to make your own decision <br>
 <br>
Thanks <br>
