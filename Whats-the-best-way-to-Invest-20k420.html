</script><p> minimum risk would be a CD or money market account.  But interest rates are low right now, and your return won&#039;t be high.  Higher risk with larger potential return would be a mutual fund, like FLATX or TRAMX. <br>
 <br>
Go visit a mutual fund broker and talk with them.

</script><p> When you invest for the short term, your No. 1 priority should be safety. You cannot afford to take a lot of risk with short-term money because you already have a goal established for those funds. As an investor, you have a number of ways to make the most of short-term investments, and choosing the right one means looking at your specific time horizon and your needs. It is short term so your best bet would be CDs because stocks and bonds requires patience&#039;s and long term investment... Years ago, bonds would have been the best answer but since interest rates are and expected to raise, this would drive bonds prices down temporary.A short-term bond fund can be a good investment and depending on the fund the yield can be higher than CDs or money market funds. But these funds are not without risk, and it is important to measure the potential loss against the increase in yield. Bond funds are sensitive to movements in interest rates, and the net asset value of a bond fund tends to decline as interest rates rise. Short-term bonds are less affected by these interest rate changes than longer-term funds, but the risk is still there. Take Care
        </p> Min Risk and Max Return, does not exist, however, Less risk with 6% annual return is possible with some 2 years bonds, or even 1 yr. <br>
 <br>
Max Risk, Max Return, &gt;&gt; buy WAMUQ. You can loose everything, be ware, but you can earn a lot. I would not put more than 3000$ in WAMUQ.  <br>
 <br>
I would not buy stock at this moment, I would wait for a retracement to 7500 or 8000 if the Dow
        </p> Why not do both?  I like the CDES method for building an investment portfolio from scratch. You can adjust the split to something you feel comfortable with. <br>
 <br>
Cash - 5k  CD/s, Money market, etc. <br>
 <br>
Debt - 5k  Bonds or bond mutual funds <br>
 <br>
Equity - 5k  Stocks (except penny stock and GM) or stock mutual funds <br>
 <br>
Stuff - 5k Gold, collectibles, penny stocks or GM, speculative foreign currency like dinars and dongs, etc.  <br>
 <br>
Investing is like picking a spouse, it is very personal and very subjective and there are no guarantees.
        </p> max risk and max return, probably foreign stocks. <br>
 <br>
min risk and max return is difficult.  some would say impossible, but it depends on how big of a return you are expecting.  For min risk/max return you could go with CDs/Money market accounts, but i would go with blue chip stocks.  However, every market is different and this one you may have a shot at reasonable minimal return and fairly decent gains.  Look into XOM and BAC and PFE, and maybe even GE if you&#039;re up to it.  If want quality recommendations, this site gives them for free.  As in you dont have to give out ANY personal info, they are just there for you to look at.  http://alpha-investing***/ <br>

They are very good, you should see their recommendations, good luck.
        </p> I would think about a longer term investment, like an IRA.
