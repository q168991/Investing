<h1>Good mutual fund to start investing in?</h1>
<div class="answer">I just started investing a little bit a couple thousand in some stocks here and there, but i want to start investing in a mutual that could potentially sky rocket, i know they are going to be risky, but im ok with that. Maybe a financial mutual fund? or energy? any thoughts would be good. Ive never bought any mutual funds.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Try to be sensible and give up this idea of making a quick buck. It does not work. <br>
 <br>
If you want to learn to be a smart and patient investor, buy an index fund, like one that mirrors the S&amp;P 500 biggest companies. The index funds outperform managed mutual funds 75% of the time, because managed funds use up a lot of the return to pay those fancy managers. Index funds, such as the Vanguard 500 have fees probably below 0.3%. <br>
The S&amp;P 500 is trading around 900, so stocks in the fund are relatively cheap.
