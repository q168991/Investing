<h1>How much money would you need to invest to make a profit in stocks?</h1>
<div class="answer">I have no knowledge whatsoever in stocks, so sorry if my question is silly or doesn&amp;#39;t make sense ^^

Basically, how much money would you need to invest to actually turn a profit?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> With stocks, it isn&#039;t money, it&#039;s diversity and time. If you&#039;re looking to turn a profit, first, do yourself a favour and pay off any existing debt that you have, because that&#039;s compounding faster in most cases than your compound interest will be, so you&#039;ll have more money in the end by doing that first.  <br>
 <br>
Then, you need to know that you can expect lots of losses, but the point is that by leaving your money in a long time, you end up with a lot of it. Compound interest means that by not withdrawing your money from investing, and scraping to add more, you end up with lots more profit.  <br>
 <br>
If you invest over a long time, an economy that grows will increase more than the losses, if you&#039;re sufficiently diversified. If it tanks, you&#039;ll want to have invested some of your money in low-risk things that aren&#039;t so volatile. So think about how long you plan to be working on this, and read some more below on what vehicles are out there to invest your money.  <br>
 <br>
The stock market won&#039;t make most people rich quickly. So let&#039;s look at some basics about what you want, how much time you have, and how much risk you tolerate.  <br>
 <br>
*I am NOT a certified investment advisor, and will instead be pointing you to other people&#039;s information. This is provided solely for general informational purposes. You would be very well advised to visit a financial planning manager at your bank, because there are a LOT of other options out there for investment, some with much lower risk.  <br>
 <br>
http://money.cnn***/magazines/moneymag/... <br>
 <br>
This is a very basic overview. There are different types of stocks out there. It&#039;s a long lesson but very clear and worth reading all the pages.  <br>
 <br>

 <br>
The motley fool is a great place to look for basic advice on what to do with your money; they aim to be accessible to regular people, not just businesspeople who invest for a living.  <br>

 <br>
*note: When they say &quot;foolishly&quot; they mean &quot;according to the motley fool&#039;s advice&quot; not stupidly. It&#039;s their tagline and brand ID.  <br>
 <br>
You can start with very little. Here&#039;s a guide to start with just $100:  <br>

and another beginner&#039;s guide: <br>
 <br>
http://education.wallstreetsurvivor***/GettingStartedInvesting <br>
 <br>
 <br>
As you can see, lots of people are talking about how to do this. BUt talk to your bank, because you will also have to deal with things like taxes, and it&#039;s always good to have someone on your side whom you can turn to for advice, and many banks offer free financial planning services. You don&#039;t have to do what they tell you, but they can make you aware of a lot of other opportunities and ways to increase your wealth- even starting very, very small. Compound interest makes fortunes, it just takes time.  <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Good luck, and remember that it&#039;s not about how much you start with.

</script><p> Hey, <br>
You should try with Penny Stocks Trading (you can find more info here: http://pennystocks.toptips.org ) <br>
 <br>
Penny stocks, also known as cent stocks in some countries, are common shares of small public companies that trade at low prices per share.  <br>
I&#039;ve been subscribing to this PennyStock web site for about a year now and have loved the objective advice they give. He really does look for quality stocks and I&#039;ve made some pretty nice profits on a lot of his suggestions. Being still fairly new to investing I have been dabbling a lot in penny stocks to try and grow my account. I may not have a big account, but it&#039;s a lot bigger than it was a year ago. On just one of Nathan&#039;s picks this year I managed to make my investment back ten-fold! Be careful! Penny stocks are notoriously risky but if you follow the right method the risk is almost 0. I suggest to invest only little money first and then reinvest the profits. This is the site I&#039;m using: http://pennystocks.toptips.org <br>
Hope it helps.
        </p> It depends. I can make a cent in the market by investing a penny in a penny stock and if it goes up I gain a few pennies (profits). But mainly how you put the money to work and what you define a good profit is. Usually stock market returns on average 8% return on your capital so in order to achieve that return you need to put money into different stocks and diversify. And no you don&#039;t need a lot of money to do that. A few thousand dollars (or even a couple of hundreds) can be utilize to diversify your investments through a mutual fund. If you  want to know how much money to put in the stock market if you&#039;re trading directly through a broker, again you don&#039;t need that much. Many small caps (small companies) trade around 1-10 dollars. Of course they are more risky in nature so if you want to stick with conservative large companies, you can also buy 10 shares or 20 shares of a big companies with a few hundred dollars. (keep in mind commission might be a big expensive if its not over 100  shares but its ok considering if you want to invest for the long term)
        </p> A penny invested could make money and a million invested could lose money.  It all depends on what you invest in.  I would suggest for a beginner to buy an overall stock market fund from Vanguard or Fidelity.  Start with a few thousand and add in some every month and DON&#039;T TOUCH IT.  In a few years you&#039;ll have made some money. <br>
 <br>
Last year people were selling stocks like crazy and I put in 15K I had been saving up.  Now it is up to 23K.
        </p> According to IRS, whenever you make profit during selling stocks, they count that profit as your INCOME. So for that IRS will tax you on the profit that you made not on the whole amount that you invested. If you invest 10 grant and made 50% profit, that 50% you have to report the next year when you fill your taxes. And even if you lost 50%, you still have to report it. When you gain money you pay taxes but when you loose money you pay nothing to IRS. You only get tax 8-10% tax based on what state you live in. I hope this helps.
        </p> You could start with any amount of money. <br>
More money does not make it more likely to make you a profit. <br>
 <br>
However, more money does open up some new possibilities, which may not be open to you as a very very small investor. <br>
 <br>
Nevertheless you can turn your $1 into $5 as esily as you can $10,000 into $50,000 <br>
 <br>
I would advise you to read a lot before investing a single $.
        </p> You don&#039;t need any money to make money.  Invest in your financial intelligence is free.  It is not the investment that is risky, it is the investor.  Investing is a plan...do your homework before you get the grade.  Good post, inspiring question.
        </p> I started off with 5000 on margin, so 10k buying power. <br>
 <br>
I could make money, but when I went to 10k with 20k buying power, things really started moving. It was great. Helped pay for my college. <br>
 <br>
I mainly traded blue chips stocks. If you&#039;re willing to take on more risk, you might be able to get away with less.
        </p> enough to cover the expenses. If you bought one share at £1 and sold it at £5 the expenses would be more than the profit. Just work it out, taking expenses at about 5% (commission, stamp and the spread)
        </p> first of all there is no guarantee of profit in the stock exchange. things could happen just like on october 29th, 1929. try starting with $10,000
