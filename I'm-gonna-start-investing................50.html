</script><p> Unless you are going to watch your stocks EVERYDAY and of course know exactly what the stock market can do for you, you need to hire a professional investor.  I watch it everyday and gameplan for my clients everyday and I still make adjustments.  These are some really tough markets and I HIGHLY advise you to have someone help you learn with them by your side.  Believe me they may be a little more expensive, but ESPECIALLY in finances, you get what you pay for.

</script><p> Sharebuilders is best for that type investing. Select from our list of over 7,000 stocks, means their not a full brokerage service. If you want to buy and sell, then Scottrade is good. IDK about Zecco. As of now there is no monthly fee for having a Scottrade account
        </p> I&#039;ve never used the 3 you mentioned but here&#039;s a couple others to consider: <br>
 <br>
thinkorswim.  $5/trade for stocks.  Great tools for technical trading if you&#039;re into that.  (I&#039;m not.)  But no tools for fundamental analysis (Personally I pay Morningstar an annual fee for that.) <br>
 <br>
Fidelity Investments.  Slightly pricier - between $8-$20 per trade for stock transactions depending on how often you trade.  But it has very good tools for fundamental analysis if you don&#039;t want to pay a 3rd party for that.  It also has some tools for technical analysis.
        </p> make investments maximum of you cash in shares by potential of coming up a varied portfolio. choose agencies in distinctive industries and ideally with a history of paying dividends. never make a million place better than 20% of your portfolio. additionally on the grounds which you&#039;re youthful, you will desire to chosen to take a place a number of you cash in riskier equities than those your grandpa might. make investments basically some in low danger securities which incorporates a CD. Take a classification on making an investment at your interior reach college in case you have no longer have been given any clue it is going to truly make it easier to out. which will probable be your maximum priceless investment for now!
        </p> Personally, I think Sogotrade is best among all online brokerages. You can get a lot of free trades: about 100 free trades with 500 minimum deposits. It has very good customer services, it also has live help, and you can chat with representatives about any question. After that, only 3 dollar for each trade, pretty sweet when compared with other online brokerages. <br>
