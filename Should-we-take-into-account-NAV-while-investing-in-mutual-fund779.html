<h1>Should we take into account NAV while investing in mutual fund?</h1>
<div class="answer">I often hear people say that NAV of a particular fund does not matter while investing. I do not fully understand it. After all the gain from investment in mutual fund depends on initial NAV  (at the time of investing) and the final NAV (at the time of redemption). So obviously my aim should be to purchase when NAV is low and sell when NAV is high. Still people seem to have opinion that NAV has nothing to do with investing in a fund. Why is it so? 
I also hear the exact opposite of this advice (without full explanation) i.e., &amp;quot;it is better to purchase at low NAV than to sell at high NAV &amp;quot;. I am confused. Can anybody please explain these issues?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> The NAV is calulated by summing up the value of the funds assets less it&#039;s liabilities and expenses and dividing that by the number of shares. The NAV of an equity fund will tend to rise when the market rises and will fall when the market falls and when it pays a dividend. So it is a rough barometer of whether the fund is growing or declining.  <br>
 <br>
I don&#039;t think you should be tracking the NAV. I think it would be better to look at the fund&#039;s performance over several time periods compared to similar funds.  <br>
 <br>
Actually, the best predictor of future equity fund performance is it&#039;s expense ratio. That is why low cost index funds are most often recommended by &quot;experts&quot; that don&#039;t benefit from mutual fund sales or media that thrives by making listeners/reading trade happy. Over time it is hard for active fund managers to beat the market consistently when they have about a 1% cost disadvantage.

</script><p> The NAV is immaterial while choosing a fund. Moreover, there is no difference between the growth and dividend reinvestment options in terms of total returns. One must remember that NAV is different from the price of a stock. A stock&#039;s price, unlike NAV, is influenced by the forces of demand and supply, external factors such as perception and investor sentiment. <br>
 <br>
The reason you should buy into a particular scheme is due to its performance potential and not its unit cost. Say you purchase one fund with a high NAV and another with a lower NAV, but more units. Assume both perform similarly, upon selling the two funds, the return on investment will be similar. Hence whether the NAV is high or low, or whether you get more units or less units, is irrelevant. What matters is the investment style of the scheme and the returns it generates.
        </p> You should not consider NAV of a Mutual Fund as a deciding factor while investing in Mutual Funds, rather you should choose a Mutual Funds depending upon his performance,a fund offered by fund house which follows sound investment systems and processes, will be the right pick for your investment portfolio.  <br>
You must select funds with a consistent performance track record, which is a function of the sound investment processes and systems followed by the fund house.
        </p> You are incorrect in stating that &quot;all the gain&quot; depends on initial NAV vs. final NAV.  You are attempting to apply a stock trading mentality to mutual funds - which is not applicable.  You need to look at TOTAL RETURN in assessing the historic performance of a mutual fund.
        </p> I guess if your in the &quot;Buy it and Forget&quot; about it, and &quot;Buy and Hold for ever&quot; crowd  nothing really matters except the supposed historical 8% return of equities through history, ..But if you do a little added research , like reading a 10 year chart of the S+P index,(which mirrors the Market)..Then you should come to the conclusion that that Strategy is Flawed, ..And NAV high or low is big money, your Gut Idea is right...also remember that most are repeating what a salesman said or wrote.
        </p> no. you buy at the current price and sell at the current price. unlike stocks, the NAV (price) is unimportant.
