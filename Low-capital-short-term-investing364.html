<h1>Low capital short-term investing?</h1>
<div class="answer">I&amp;#39;m a student in college and have just over $2,000 in savings, collecting .08% interest. I don&amp;#39;t know much about investing, in any aspect, but am very interested in knowing more. If possible, I would like to invest for 3-6 months at a time. If you have any real advice (not being a wise a**), please respond with any information available. Thanks!<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Investing in precious metals seems to be a good bet.  Gold and silver prices fluctuate which is sort of a high risk high potential for reward.  You probably won&#039;t make a fortune, but the prices of both metals change daily, so buy low, and sell high. <br>

Yes, you can buy completely online.  You can buy PM on eBay, Amazon, pretty much anywhere but to ensure that your PM isn&#039;t fraudulent or &#039;filled&#039;, I&#039;d buy from a reputable company like Kitco (google it).   <br>
So the pricing works like this - let&#039;s say Silver spot or Gold spot (Spot = the current base price) - silver  is currently at $33.180 /oz.  To show you exactly how unstable it is, last month it was under $29 /oz.  So when you buy silver or gold, companies will charge you spot price ($33.18 silver) +  a percentage over spot.  It&#039;s usually like $3 or $4 per oz, it depends on who you buy from.  So in essence, smart buying goes something like this: <br>
 <br>
Current silver spot = $33.   Buy now, or silver drops to $31.  A person buys 10 oz of silver for $310 + price over spot = $3 per oz = $30 for 10oz  = total cost of $340.   You wait to see if silver goes up, let&#039;s say it jumps to $37/oz over the next 5-7 months.  That means you have 10/oz of silver you paid $340, that would now be worth $370 + whatever price over spot you wanted to charge someone.  Now this is just a small scale investing pattern so the profit doesn&#039;t seem that much, but when you start investing in a larger scale, the profit (along with the risk) also goes up.  To be fair though, no one can accurately predict whether spot will go up or not, so that&#039;s why its a risk instead of a sure thing.  Proceed with caution and don&#039;t invest anything you can&#039;t afford to lose.  I started small, and just added on when I could afford to.
