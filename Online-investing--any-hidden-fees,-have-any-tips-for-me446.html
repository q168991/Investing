<h1>Online investing- any hidden fees, have any tips for me?</h1>
<div class="answer">I don&amp;#39;t have that much experience investing. Im thinking about throwing a couple thousand dollars into an online stock broker like etrade, ameritrade, scott trade, etc. Any startup tips for me? Which site do you recommend? Also, they always advertise $7-8 trades..... does that completely cover the trade fees? or are there hidden charges, commission fees, etc? I&amp;#39;m not good with all the lingo in their terms.....<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Scottrade is great if you know what you&#039;re doing. Schwab &amp; Fidelity (Brokerage) may be better if you need a little assistance. <br>
 <br>
Don&#039;t do anything until you understand investing. Don&#039;t ever take stock tips. Don&#039;t just buy your first stock because it sounds great or it&#039;s &quot;just always going up&quot;. <br>
 <br>
Learn Learn Learn before you buy one thing. Have a plan. Understand &quot;asset allocation&quot;. Never buy anything without fully knowing it &amp; why you&#039;re buying it (Uncle Joe says it&#039;s going to triple in two weeks is not a reason to buy). <br>
 <br>
Good luck.  The right approach will make you rich slowly. <br>
The wrong approach will make you poor quickly..........

</script><p> I think Scottrade is annoying.  Everytime I want to take money out I have to call the local office and setting it up was a pain since i had to call the office and mail in my forms. The website has been down a few times as well.  Every once in a while scottrade will split my trade into two and charge me 7 dollars both times for 14 a trade so you can do all or none to avoid this but you might get a lower price for your stock. <br>
Personally I like ameritrade a lot better and have had fewer problems and i dont have to call the office.  I can do everything online which for me was the whole point of getting an online broker.  The trades are a few dollars more but I think its worth it for the better execution.
        </p> Unfortunately, there is no way to safely invest that I am aware of. Certainly, some are safer than others. There are four factors to keep in mind in making an investment--risk, expected return, taxes, and inflation. Obviously you want your expected return to be higher than inflation and taxes and you want your expected risk to be as low as possible. The advent of the Roth IRA account has eliminated taxes from the equation and therefore is something that every investor should partake of. Inflation is the most insidious of factors. It eats away at your returns and then the government taxes you on it. Cute of them. On top of that they under report inflation so that the population will not think it is so severe as it is. Consequently, fixed income investments which are considered safer than equity investments are really not. I do not know the safest way or best way. But generally speaking a diversified portfolio of equity investments is considered by many to be an excellent approach to accumulating a large sum of money over a long period of time. A way to begin is to invest in a diversified mutual fund such as Vanguard Global Equity Fund and as you accumulate more wealth you can diversify into other equity investments. I might also add that a steady contribution to ones investments on a regular basis is a necessary prerequisite to accumulating a large sum of money.
        </p> I would like &quot;buy  and hold&quot;, get your Costco membership card and use its referral service to open an investment account with Sharebuilder***, put any amount over $4 in, then one month later you will get a rebate of $55 (minimum) to start with. You may select a company like McDonald (MCD) or Yums Brand (YUM) to invest, say you deposit $104, and $4 for commission, then $104 - $55 = $49 which is the cost of purchase. Almost 50% off to buy a good company. You can open many accounts as you wish. Then 5 years later, if MCD or YUM gives you a double and you only pay $16 to get out, i.e., you walk away $184 ($200-$16=$184) or 275.5% ($184/$49-1) in return (or 55% annual return)
        </p> I use Scottade. They charge $7 per trade.  <br>
 <br>
Just remember that it&#039;s $7 to buy, then another $7 to sell so you need to add $14 total to your stock prices. If you buy stocks under $1, they add on an additional 1/2%. <br>
 <br>
I&#039;ve been with Scottrade for about 6 months now and am very happy with their service and website. <br>
 <br>
Good luck!
