<h1>Is a Fund too much of an investing risk?</h1>
<div class="answer">I have always been a very conservative investor with little risk tolerance. A CD has matured and it is being suggested that I invest the money in the J.P. Morgan Core Bond Fund instead. The Fund is without FDIC protection, but I have been told it has **** protection. Am I being overly cautious? Should I seriously consider investing in the Fund? Thank you.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Is JP Morgan getting your broker&#039;s commission on this recommendation? It only gets a 3-star rating at Morningstar. If you just want the dividend that is fair enough, but go to Morningstar*** and find some better performing and better rated bond funds. Look for no-load or low-load funds.

</script><p> You should have SIPC protection, which is a lot like FDIC.  Its an intermediate term bond fund that invest in investment grade bonds.  The biggest risk is if interest rates increase the value of your shares in the fund will go down.  It has a decent yield for an intermediate bond fund.  But they may be juiceing their yields with some riskier bonds or loans.  Their turnover is very low at 18 percent which is good.  The front end load isnt very high and there is nothing inherently wrong with load funds as long as the load is low.  They have beat their benchmark index in every timeframe, which is excellent.  But the past is no indicator of the future.  Morningstar ratings are subject to change and you should plan to be in the fund for the long term.  The important thing is does a bond fund fit your risk tolerance.   Its quite a bit different than a CD.  If you may need the money in the short term stick with CDs.
        </p> I&#039;m assuming you live in a country with no inflation and no income taxes because you have little risk tolerance and for a CD that earns a negative return after inflation and taxes makes no sense to me. The Fund has insurance. Investing in a Fund never makes sense especially in poor performing bonds.
        </p> The reason you are getting this advice is because of the brokerage commission of 2.25% for selling it to you.  You do not want a bond fund at this junction.  Stick with short term CDs--2 year max.
