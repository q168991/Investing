<h1>Is it a good time to start investing?</h1>
<div class="answer">I have a little money saved and a regular income, and have been thinking for a while to get an investment ISA with an ethical fund.  
Now - there&amp;#39;s two factors I think may affect how good the timing is to start investing.  First, the world economy is a bit in the dumps, so for that reason it could be a good time to start investing, as the only way is up in the coming years (or the most likely way, anyway).  The second factor is that the UK economy is doing more than averagely bad compared to other countries, and thus the exchange rate even compared to other countries, is very bad.  I.e. the value of the pound is low at the moment.  Now if I invested in foreign shares, I&amp;#39;d be buying them with UK pounds.  As the pound isn&amp;#39;t worth much at the moment but may improve, the value of shares in foreign currencies will thereby drop in comparison.
Is this reasoning correct?  Is it still a good time to start investing now - i.e. does the currency variation not change much, or should I wait to see if the exchange rate improves?  I don&amp;#39;t know much about investing, so thanks for any advice you could offer!<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> It&#039;s always a good time to start investing for the simple reason of if not now then when?   Of course, it&#039;s a good idea to build up an emergency fund first as you don&#039;t want a crisis to force you out of your investment positions. <br>
 <br>
As to ethical funds, you&#039;re deferring the judgement of ethics to someone else just as you are deferring financial judgement to someone else in any fund.   Unless you can research the fund manager, his philosophies and management strategy thoroughly then all you&#039;re going on is the marketing material hence there&#039;s no guarantee that the money is truly being invested ethically or responsibly by your standards.   I see no point in funds other than indexed funds with varying degrees of beta as most funds are very opaque as to management strategy and some do not specify who their fund manager is other than stating that they have a competent management team.   Stay with index funds or better yet learn how to invest yourself.   If you want to be socially conscious, budget some philanthropy with the money that you make. <br>
 <br>
A strategy to deal with unpredictable relative price movements like the exchange rate or even stock market movements in general would be portfolio rebalancing.   To illustrate, imagine a $1,000 portfolio where you target 50% to be in cash and the other 50% in a stock, you would start with $500 cash, $500 stock and the stock price drops in half leaving you with $500 cash, $250 stock so you buy $125 stock to rebalance to 50/50, $375 cash, $375 stock.   The stock price returns to it&#039;s starting price and you have $375 cash, $750 stock for a portfolio value of $1,125 all while the stock price has net zero change in price.  This is called volatility pumping and works very well in foreign currencies as currencies allow for fewer transactions to balance a portfolio.   That is a portfolio of three currencies with a third of the portfolio value in each currency requires only two or less transactions to rebalance.   A portfolio of two stocks and cash with a third in each also requires two trades or less o rebalance but since all trades must to and from cash, it requires on average more trades and hence trading costs then a portfolio of three currencies.   With a sufficiently large portfolio, currency variations are just another opportunity to make money through portfolio management.

</script><p> Agree with John W. The key is to start investing. If you wait for the &quot;right&quot; time, you well never get started. In fact, what feels like the right time is probably when the market has gone up a lot and everyone is positive....which is the wrong time to invest! Use index funds to keep costs to a minimum. That means you keep more of the return and less goes to fund managers. Drip feeding money on a monthly basis gives you &quot;pound cost averaging&quot;. In other words, if the market goes down, whilst the fund holding that you currently have will go down, you&#039;ll be able to buy more units with your next monthly investment. This is safer than putting big chunks of money into the market in one go.  <br>

        </p> When investing it is good to either know everything or nothing i.e. if you don&#039;t know much, either spend some time really learning everything there is to know or simply trust a professional with your money. <br>
 <br>
The pound is weak because it was aloud to devalue when it needed to to stimulate the economy and make trade competitive, something the dollar and euro weren&#039;t free to do and so are slightly overvalued in some peoples eyes. However some other currencies aren&#039;t overvalued e.g. the Yuan.  <br>
 <br>
Currency variation can be important e.g. the pound lost 25% against the dollar in the financial crises, so if you invest in the US and the pound bounces back you will be missing out. you&#039;ve also got many other questions e.g. bonds or equities, emerging or developed markets. As I said earlier, I&#039;d learn it all or trust a pro with a good record.  <br>

        </p> I was paying a broker too much money for what I was getting. I decided to let go of my broker (in October 2008- which is significant) and invest on my own. My bank offers on-line banking. I made an appointment with the investment banker and she showed me the ropes. I do my own research and I decide which stocks I will buy. I like having the control to buy and sell stocks and I have some good hunches that have made me a nice profit. There are sites that charge a nominal fee, and I truly mean nominal, like $7.00 for a transaction but I prefer investing through my bank. My stock portfolio is there at a click of a button along with my banking. I think you might like going through your bank if you are new to investing. Good luck.
        </p> Penny stocks are loosely categorized companies with share prices of below $5 and with market caps of under $200 million. They are sometimes referred to as &quot;the slot machines of the equity market&quot; because of the money involved. There may be a good place for penny stocks in the portfolio of an experienced, advanced investor, however, if you follow this guide you will learn the most efficient strategies https://tr.im/c8109
        </p> Shares are risky, land is an investment some people turn to as it is constant however that to can be risky.
