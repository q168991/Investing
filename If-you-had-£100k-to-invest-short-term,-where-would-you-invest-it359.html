<h1>If you had £100k to invest short term, where would you invest it?</h1>

Similarly, severe loss can occur and many penny stocks lose all of their value in the long term. Accordingly, the SEC warns that penny stocks are high risk investments and new investors should be aware of the risks involved but you can even make very big money. These risks include limited liquidity, lack of financial reporting, and fraud. A penny stock is a common stock that trades for less than $5 a share. While penny stocks generally are quoted over-the-counter, such as on the OTC Bulletin Board or in the Pink Sheets, they may also trade on securities exchanges, including foreign securities exchanges. In addition, penny stocks include the securities of certain private companies with no active trading market. Although a penny stock is said to be &quot;thinly traded,&quot; share volumes traded daily can be in the hundreds of millions for a sub-penny stock. Legitimate information on penny stock companies can be difficult to find and a stock can be easily manipulated.

        </p> I would put the max possible into Premium Bonds for a chance of winning up to 1million tax free. The rest I would probably buy property with.
        </p> Spend 10k pounds in the UK lottery and get a 9month or 1 year certificate deposit in an online bank like ING Direct You should get a good rate based on the deposit.

         Forex market...In the last 5 years our experience is 300-500% return yearly! Our broker can verify it for you.If you aggressive enough you can double it in a month...! With that kind of capital you can retire for the rest of your life with steady income of GBP3-5K a week.
        </p> Put the money into an INGDirect account, it will pay you monthly interest at 5% per year (minus tax) you can get at your cash at any time and every month you will earn interest which you can also reap.... if after 1 month just withdraw the lot................
        </p> GOLD, We will see prices rise $100 ounce by Dec 31, 3007.
        </p> Buying some gold or corn or oil futures might increase your fortunate in the short run. But it is risky as well. watchout!!
        </p> Split your capital into £5k parcels and spread them in different investments. Have you ever seen a squirrel bury his/her acorns in one place , but then squirrels are smarter, aren`t they.
        </p> I know the answer but i am keeping it a secret
        </p> don&#039;t invest the money...just pimp out your lady friends and family
        </p> the first dodgy email in your in box
        </p> anice car, the stock market, become a pimp
         porn and a web cam!
