<h1>What&#039;s the best way to invest 500 dollars for a quick high return?</h1>
<div class="answer">What would you suggest is the best way to do this? I have 500 bucks I&amp;#39;d like to invest and see grow very well within a year.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> A quick high return would be very high risk.  Even so it is hard to pull much interest from $500 within a year.  I would just drop it in to a savings account at say, ***hsbcdirect*** <br>
It is an online savings account, FDIC insured paying back just over 5%.  If you decide to go with stocks, you won&#039;t have much time to look into them so you will have to look to an expert otherwise you will just decide it isn&#039;t worth the time.

You could use this with Forever Living Products which you can actually start for nothing, but with $500 you could have a flying start. <br>
With them you can do as many or as few hours as you like and typically on 1-2 hours a day you will earn £1200 per month after 5 months and £30-£40k per year after 2-3 years - if you do more hours you should get more. <br>
 <br>
They are a $2 billion company growing at 25% per year and need a lot more people - no investment required also, regulated by Dti and Office of Fair trading and have investors in people award also. <br>

 <br>
Research all stocks that are volatile on the day they report earnings.  Find the most historically volatile one and a few days before earnings, buy one call and one put option at near term expiration (this is known as a &quot;straddle&quot; in the investing world). <br>
 <br>
You can expect 200%-500% return, depending what the bid-ask spread is when you buy.   <br>
The only way to lose is if the stock does not move up or down on the day of earnings.
        </p> Put it in a Managed Investment if they will let you invest $500. They pool everyones money together and get higher interest that way which they pass onto you - maybe 8%. Try a company like BT Bankers Trust or look up Managed Investment Portfolios.

Check out my blog on some tips to earning money on the Internet, as well as a list of websites I actively use to earn the money. They are 100% free (and I 100% guarantee it!) and scam-free. I have been paid by everyone. From a few of the websites, I earned a little over $200 for the month of December, but your earnings could be much greater.  <br>
 <br>
http://***swatcash***/2147    &lt; Using that website alone I have made over $100 in under a week. It&#039;s a really great website. You can earn cash as well as Paypal bonuses, Visa Gift Card&#039;s and they even have referral contests for cash, as well as giveaways for Nintendo Wii, Ipod Nano and PS3.
        </p> The question is incomplete--you need to also specify the degree of risk you are ready to take (because aiming for better return requires to take on more risk of losing money). For instance, if you are not so risk averse, you might buy emerging market assets which can grow very quickly (up to 50 percent a year) but also drop as quickly!
        </p> Quick 500 Dollars
        </p> Buy 27000 shares of PBLS at the opening bell in the morning <br>
and sell it for a  minimum 50% gain on Thursday.. <br>
 <br>
anybody think this will happen ?? <br>
 <br>
Keep an eye on PBLS  and research the &quot;snots&quot; out of this issue. <br>
Watch this weeks trading it will blow some of the non-believers away. <br>
 <br>
At .0185 it is the best value on the market &quot;Bar None&quot; <br>
