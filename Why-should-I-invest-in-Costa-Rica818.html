</script><p> As a real estate agent in Spain, I have to say Costa Rica is an excellent place to invest. I myself plan to relocate there some time early 2008. The GDP and employment are on the up, crime is very low, education and health services are excellent. The property market is way below comparable locations near by and all indications are that it will continue to grow for a good few years yet. Also, you can swim in the Caribbean in the morning and the pacific in the afternoon. How cool is that.

</script><p> well for one my grandma has a lot of real estate in costa rica...she owns 5 houses in all different parts, yet let me tell you the money there is very different than here and may seem quite cheap and not worth it, but if you are planning to move to costa rica than this is the perfect thing to do since it is the fastest way to get money there. Also if you want to invest there you could always money launder JK!
        </p> cost rica is a nice investment proprty proces are still low there and any money put into real estate will most definately go up!  the contry itself is beautiful the water is clear. the fishing is fablous and pulls alot of fisherman form all over the word
