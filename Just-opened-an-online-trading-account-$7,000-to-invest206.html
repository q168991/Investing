</script><p> I don&#039;t know about those stocks, but you may want to wait a little while if those aren&#039;t going up at all this week. My advice is: <br>
 <br>
Choose a stock of a solid company (or a mutual fund) that you believe has a future, and has a 3-5 year record of consistent growth of its share/stock price. It must be a US or foreign company (or mutual fund) that trades on a US stock exchange. Look in on its price and news articles (like through Yahoo Finance) every few days or daily to make sure nothing tragic is occurring to your particular company or stock’s value. But HOLD it (except in the event of some major free-fall). Jumping in and out (selling the shares and buying them again within 3 business days) to avoid losses is only permitted by stock exchange rules if you are a ‘margin trader’. As you earn money you should also buy the stock of a company in a different industry, but using the same evaluation technique as above. Eventually you should hold at least one solid company&#039;s stock in several healthy industries. <br>
This is a simple stock market plan that should serve you very well.  <br>
 <br>
You’ll need to contact a brokerage to start an account. I like Fidelity and Scottrade. Both have online trading. If you don’t have an IRA (Individual Retirement Account) I would start a Roth IRA as the account in which to keep your stock because all the earnings/gains are tax-free. A HUGE benefit. And max the allowed contributions whenever you can afford to. You can’t withdraw this money until age 59 ½ without a major penalty, but still the wise thing to start first. You can also start a second regular brokerage account at the same time and place whatever amount of stocks in it, if you feel more comfortable knowing you can sell off and withdraw the money anytime. But you’ll have to pay capital gains tax on those withdrawals.  <br>
 <br>
Good luck.  <br>
 <br>

</script><p> I would wait, I think this stock market may go down another 10-20%.  We are not at a bottom yet, to get in now would be catching a falling knife.  THere is NO catalyst to change this negative trend.
        </p> There is in fact a catalyst that may turn this around - interest rates. <br>
 <br>
Investment companies will make a killing in this market with all the buying and selling.
        </p> Good luck. If anyone had a 100% fool-proof answer, they would be king. Nobody can accurately predict the future. Read financial columns and absorb as much information as you can. Then read more. Then invest.
        </p> well it may be best to wait until after quarterly reports are released before you invest that money. Lots of companies are feeling the hurt of the sub prime mortgage problem.

i have attended a lot of seminars, read counless books on forex trading and it all cost me thousands of dollars. the worst thing was i blew up my first account. after that i opened another account and the same thing happened again. i started to wonder why i couldn,t make any money in forex trading. at first i thought i knew everything about trading. finally i found that the main problem i have was i did not have the right mental in trading. as we know that psychology has great impact on our trading result. apart from psychology issue, there is another problem that we have to address. they are money management, market analysis, and entry/exit rules. to me money management is important in trading. i opened another account and start to trade profitably after i learnt from my past mistake. i don&#039;t trade emotionally anymore.  <br>
if you are serious about trading you need to address your weakness and try to fix it. no forex guru can make you Professional trader unless you want to learn from your mistake.
        </p> Wait it out if you are investing for the long term.
        </p> Give it 3 more days then shoval it in like coal
        </p> I like nothing for the next year...............need to see the new president..........
