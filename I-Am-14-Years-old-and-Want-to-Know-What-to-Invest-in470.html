<h1>I Am 14 Years old and Want to Know What to Invest in?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am a 14 year old and I currently have money in the stock market. I bought in October last year and I am currently up $350. I invested $1000 in Foster Wheeler, Vale, and A-Power (My largest holding-115 shares) I just wanted to know what else to invest in. I have $300 more. I also have my whole life to wait for a turn.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Do not invest in individual stocks. Can you say Enron, Worldcom and AIG? This is very high risk... you are gambling not investing. Take the money and invest in growth stock mutual funds with a long track record. This way you are sufficiently diversified. <br>
 <br>
Lots of adults play individual stocks and its a dumb move for long-term investing. More than 95 percent of day traders do not beat the market average over +10 years. The vast majority lose money. Why would you do something you only have less than a 5 percent chance of beating the market at? <br>
 <br>
SandP 500 index funds, total stock market index funds, invest in them and leave alone. And we&#039;ll see you at the yacht club in 30 years.

</script><p> Listen to what a few previous answers were, invest in your school, put what money you have in a bank CD or something save and use it for school. After that, I certainly encourage you to save regularly particularly in a 401k, Most employers match their workers money, giving you a 50% return as soon as you put your money in the account.
        </p> I&#039;d invest in oil &amp; other fossil fuels companies,since gasoline usage peaks during summer months,also the major oil companies are merging like crazy as well.
        </p> Read, Rich Dad Poor Dad. <br>
