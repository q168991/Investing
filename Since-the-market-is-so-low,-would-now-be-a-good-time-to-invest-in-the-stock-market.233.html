</script><p> LOW? <br>
 <br>
The dow is almost 8,000!!! It was 6,500 a couple weeks ago and we have a long way to go before we hit 2,000! <br>
 <br>
Have you seen that our 50 day, 200 day, 500 day and 1000 day moving average is all declining!  Do you really think the market is low when this is the case? <br>
 <br>
SHORT THIS MARKET!  This casino game we call the stock market is nothing more than a ponzi scheme and based on the 2012 shift in consciousness the Mayan Calendar talks about (and they have been right 100% as of now, so why are they going to be wrong tommorow?) <br>
 <br>
We have a long way to go before we reach 2,000 DOW as with almost 20% unemployment (Shadowstats***) and a fiat currency on the verge of collapse, you think stocks are the way to go (LOL).  I hope you do not trust CNBC for they lie to us, and always have for the government controls the media and the government always lies to us also. <br>
 <br>
Did you not see what VISIONVICTORY and MANOFTRUTH have been saying on Youtube?  These guys know what they are talking about and here to help us.   <br>
 <br>
However, if you wanted to invest in the casino stock market, the best code right now I think is SKF or FAZ which is a short fund on the financial markets which is for XLF to go down in price which it should. <br>
 <br>

 <br>
You have to do your research.  Read the prospectuses of ETFs and mutual funds.  Don&#039;t buy individual stocks to start; they&#039;re too risky.  Find an ETF and dollar cost average your money in; don&#039;t just take a lump sum and put it all in and hope for the best.  You should read some books on investing to know what you&#039;re doing or you could lose a lot of money. <br>
 <br>
The stock market isn&#039;t a casino.  It takes time.  If you have 10 years or more, now may be a good time, based on historical data.  There&#039;s never a crystal ball, but the market usually bounces back in a relatively big way.  That doesn&#039;t mean what you pick will bounce back, so make sure to reasearch your pick thoroughly.
        </p> It&#039;s an excellent time to invest.  Stocks are undervalued and dividend yields are higher. <br>
 <br>
I would suggest diversifying in a variety so if one sector doesn&#039;t perform well the others might.  I keep all my financial risks evenly weighted.  Diversification is the only area of risk management that I&#039;ve truly mastered. <br>

Some investors are cautious now because of the 2008 down-trend, even though the market is currently going up.  Nevertheless, give it a few years to a decade when the up-trend accelerates and even people who don&#039;t know what they&#039;re doing will think they&#039;re experts because everyones making money. <br>
 <br>
If someone told me the next upturn will be like the roaring &#039;20&#039;s, I would give them my full attention.  With so much USD being printed, if that eventually finds its way into the stock market, god help us.  People will be euphoric.  Then when there&#039;s not much money left to invest, we could see a crash like 1929 or 1987.  You can understand now why the government and the federal reserve is in such a hurry to regulate Wall Street while there&#039;s enough fear prior to the next stock market bubble.  They can forecast the disaster as quickly as I can. <br>
 <br>
Watch this 1929 documenary.  I&#039;m sure you&#039;ll find it interesting: http://video.google***.au/videoplay?doc... <br>
 <br>
Invest in books on risk management then you can enjoy the stock market without the fear or delayed fear that leads to panic at the top of a market cycle later on.  Right now we&#039;re at the bottom of one. <br>
 <br>
Short Term Risk Management (Trading): <br>
Know what you&#039;re willing to lose.  If you buy a stock for $55/share, decide what price you will cut your losses if it doesn&#039;t go up.  Better to sell at say $40 planned before the trade than watch it go down to $1 which is what Citi Group did before it rebounded. <br>
 <br>
Long-Term Risk Management (Investing) <br>
Does the company that the stock apply to make net profit? <br>
Does the company pay dividends? <br>
Does the company provide a product or service that has constant demand.? <br>
Never borrow to invest when investing long term.  Margin loans are only good for short term trading. <br>
 <br>
Yahoo finance is good for research on stocks: http://***yahoo***/finance
        </p> any time is probably a good time to invest in the stock market (usually with a broad index mutual fund), but your time horizon for withdrawal should be very distant. Of course the DJIA will rise above 16,000 eventually, making last August and September a great time to invest. It&#039;s just likely going to take a long time for that to happen.
        </p> One thing about a market being &quot;so low&quot; that <br>
should concern you is it going lower.  The <br>
stock market peaked a little over a year ago,  <br>
so the current decline has been brief. <br>
 <br>
It took almost 4 years for the market to bottom <br>
after the crash of 1929, and another ten years <br>
to return to pre-crash price levels. <br>
 <br>
There is an answer here, but most do not <br>
want to heed it and will look for &quot;bargains,&quot; <br>
instead of looking for strength. <br>
 <br>
Take a look at this web site: <br>
 <br>
http://beta.investors*** <br>
 <br>
I have no interest in or ties to it, so I am not <br>
&quot;promoting&quot; it.  That site follows the market <br>
philosophy of William O&#039;Neil, now dead, but <br>
he wrote an excellent book, &quot;How To Make <br>
Money In Stocks.&quot;  Do not hesitate to spend <br>
about $15, and buy it. <br>
 <br>
The rest is up to you.
        </p> Dont listen to what EndlessM... has to say. Where are his credentials to support his pessimism...some youtube show? How about assessing the fundamentals and what proven people like Warren Buffett and Noriel Roubini, lloyd blankfein and other good wall street analysts and investors. The truth of the matter is, the markets wont die. they still have downside to go but i think the 6500 is a relative bottom seeing that we have life in us enough to bring us up to around 8000 currently and while america is hurting, we have shown life. housing numbers are improving and retail sales were positive. banks really cant fail once geithners bank plan is executed. China will be able to lead us out of the recession. My advice is to start playing the oil stocks like exxon and chevron. oil has bottomed and has to stray away from the stock market&#039;s trends. opec has been making good decisions and our recent supply census shows that oil will be going up. its the next commodity to get hot after gold which has peaked for now. Recently, some of our treasury bills went negative. i believe they will continue to go since investors will flee of this declining trend, fear of the democratics running the country into the ground with debt-pushing the yields lower. investors will flee to gold in around two months...it will fall til then...and oil as i have stated earlier. Also, with the bond issues, money will go into the market. Buy up some safe undervalued banks like Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, and Goldman Sachs. All of those companies havnt been killed by the banking crisis and have stated good outlooks. Medical is hot and will continue to be. buy mylan MYL, its a generic pharm maker that leads the industry and will spike with obamas healthcare plans. its up like 80% in the past 5 months and will continue to grow. Celgene CELG biotech very strong fundamentals and demend. Get exposure to china by buy BHP and KO. if you want to try to profit off the decline in bills and bonds buy futures option puts on some of them, if thats too advanced go with PST. it shorts various US ten year govt bonds and notes
        </p> well ye  it has already started recovering. banks are going up    house sales in america are going up    everything is on its way up  12 months from now it will be all over.    as long as there is not a world war within the next 12 months the markets will recover so quickly that alot of investors will miss there money making opportunity.  damn i lost out on £4,500 profit with barclays in the last 6 weeks cause i didnt invest.     it only takes 1 month 4 trading weeks for a big portion of a companies share price to rise back to high price.
        </p> Calculate how much you are prepared to lose and go from there. <br>
You might be better to just let $ sit in the bank?? Nobody ever thought GM stock would go for this low! If we all knew the answer, we&#039;d buy today and make millions. Good luck!
        </p> I think it is a very good time to get into the market.  Basically, everything is half off what it was a year and a half ago. <br>
 <br>
Of course, my market predictions have been horribly wrong in the past.  Yet, I&#039;m continuing to put 15% of my pay in my 401k, which is mostly invested in stocks.
        </p> It is best to buy whenever you have savings. It is best to invest regularly. It is more important to select good scrips on basis of profitability prospects of companies. The shares of such companies should be accumulated over a period of time. In the long run, such scrips give good profits by way of dividend, bonus shares, capital appreciation.
         Don&#039;t try to catch falling knives.  Someone told me recently, &quot;at $1 a share, how can you lose?&quot;  That stock is now at $0.01 a share. <br>

         Keep in mind that there&#039;s always money to be made in the stock market, no matter what! Something is going up and something is going down. For you, this all depends on how long you&#039;re wanting to wait for a return, what you&#039;re thinking of investing in, etc. That really applies to everyone. The market will be down again. It will probably go back down to the 6,500 level and lower, even to 6,200 or less, possibly 5,900 or less. The market isn&#039;t recovering, this is just a bear market rally. The economy isn&#039;t recovering yet, just look around you, listen to people, go to a soup kitchen, ride a public bus. Find out how many people are out of work. I&#039;ve been out of work for a year, no jobs to be found. 50 people showing up for a part time job and hundreds and even thousands showing up for ONE full time position. <br>
 <br>
More layoffs are going to occur, travel is being cut back by those who would like to travel, people are cutting corners because they want to or have to. What does that mean? Lower earnings! Lower revenues, more businesses closing, commercial loans defaulting, etc. Unemployment is rising and will rise more. Plus, when they report the unemployment data, they don&#039;t reveal the whole truth any longer! They don&#039;t include everyone to make it look better. They don&#039;t include me because I don&#039;t collect unemployment, they don&#039;t include the homeless who want jobs, they don&#039;t include others. Unemployment is actually much higher too! Officially, there was about 12.5 million unemployed here in this country, but in reality there&#039;s over 14 million unemployed, possibly as many as 15 to 17 million unemployed. <br>
 <br>
I am investing though, because even using the little that I have to gain something is better than just spending it all and becoming poorer in the process. The market will go up and down and up and down. It always does. This is a good time to invest for short term and long term profits boths. Just make certain that it&#039;s money that you don&#039;t have to pull out because if your investment decreases in value, you might have to wait for it to increase. Two or three of my stocks might not increase, but I don&#039;t have that much in them for now. The others should, but there&#039;s no guarantee. If GM is facing bankruptcy, how many other companies are facing the same thing? Dozens are! A month ago, when no one wanted the banks, Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac, and others, including AIG, they were a tremendous buying opportunity. If you had money in them you could have made 50 to 150% and more in less than a month if you already sold or sold today. They will go down again, but then they&#039;ll start to rise up more too! Hopefully the bottom will be in between the end of April or May and no later than August through November. What&#039;s being done only prolongs the bottom from coming. <br>
 <br>
Inflation will probably go much higher in the next one and one-half years to three years, gold will go back up, other metals too! even now some of them are a good buying opportunity, just as they were back in November of last year through February of this year! <br>
 <br>
Listen to what the others are telling you as well! Edgetrader and EndlessMountain are right as well as others. Alan K is a bit too optimistic for me, and that is how it is with those who are out of touch with the poor! I&#039;m poor, yet I invest what little I have, and I don&#039;t even have $3,000 at this moment, but I made over 60% during the last month! When the market hit 7,900 just recently, I knew there would be more bad news and profit taking, and I can&#039;t blame anyone for taking out there profits to be safe and looking for another investment to make. <br>
 <br>
The deeper the recession the longer it takes to reach a bottom as well, and Cramer and others have already called too many bottoms. The bottom will come when it comes and it&#039;s not here yet. It would be nice for that to happen, but it&#039;s not in yet! You can check out my blog at 360 as I&#039;ve been right on the money before. Alan K is right on oil though! Oil right now is a good investment, and the smaller oil companies and those that are the exploration and supply companies as well! Over the next two to four months, oil is a great buy and so are most of the stocks related to it, but not just Exxon and Chevron. They&#039;re overvalued right now! Wait until they get below $65 again, even below $60! for Exxon. Of course, you could also hold a portion and wait and see if it goes below $56 once more! Probably solar and other alternative energy companies including ethanol! They&#039;re very low right now, some are running from them, and that&#039;s a good time to buy, just like the banks were a good time to buy about a month ago or AIG was at 40 and 50 cents a share. But get out of them when you have a profit and only leave a little in them until they look better. Don&#039;t believe everything you here on CNBC, Fox, NBC, CBS or elsewhere for that matter scutinize things more than the analysts do! You&#039;ll be better off. Most everyone I know that&#039;s even considering investing is waiting it out. Even most of them didn&#039;t think the bottom was in back in October and November when Cramer and others were calling bottoms! Now more people are saying the bottom is in, and most of the people I know still don&#039;t believe it is. Most of them are older than me, and even some are younger and see things better than most of the so called pros do who lose your money! You&#039;ll have to wait and see that I&#039;m right! Remember this! Remember what people are telling you. Only some of the companies out there are undervalued right now! You have to hunt for deals!
