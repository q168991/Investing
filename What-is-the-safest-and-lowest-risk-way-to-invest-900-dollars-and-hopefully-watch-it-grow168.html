</script><p> GET OUT OF THE USA DOLLAR <br>
 <br>
Buy silver or gold or real assets of some worth and then you can see your value working against the inflationary period that is coming. <br>
 <br>
Money is nothing more than debt and when the dollar collapses you will be very happy that you have real silver or gold to hedge your bets. <br>
 <br>
If you want to gamble on the casino stock market, then buy yourself some SKF and then sell it next week or week after when it is around 150 and make over 50% profit on the ordeal and then buy silver, but the casino we know as the stock market is a mean vengeful being whom doesn&#039;t allow small timers and $900 is a small timer for commissions are around $20 with TD making it that you realistically need at least $2,000 to beat the system. <br>
 <br>
Please GET OUT OF THE USA DOLLAR or any Fiat currency

</script><p> US Treasuries are the &quot;safest&quot; but the return is nearly zero these days. TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) are a special - their interest rate is a fixed rate plus the current inflation rate. The minimum purchase amount is $100.  <br>
 <br>
Next in safety is CD&#039;s from a FDIC insured bank. The interest rate is a little higher but your investment is also protected by the US gov&#039;t. Normally the min amount is $1000.  <br>
 <br>
A savings account at a FDIC insured bank is also protected by the US gov&#039;t. The min amount is usually $25 or so.  <br>
 <br>
Next would be to invest in a highly rated bond fund. Min for a mutual fund would be $3000 or so.  This is the first investment that I have mentioned in which you could lose money.  <br>
 <br>
&quot;General wisdom&quot; is that you should have 3-6 months of living expenses in a safe place ie savings account or CD for emergencies. So I would suggest that you keep this in a savings account until you have $1000 then purchase a short term (3 month?) CD. Keep doing that until you have that 3-6 month emergency fund.  <br>
 <br>
However if you want to invest this money for the long term (5 years +) and your emergency fund needs are taken care of....then I would suggest the stock market. You probably don&#039;t have enough to purchase a index fund that would spread your risk over many companies. With $900, you probably only have enough to purchase stock in one or two companies without spending all your money on commisions. I would suggest you purchase roughly $450 each of Exxon Mobil  and Wal-Mart.  I believe they will be a reasonable investment over the next 5 years. (Note that normally to be diversified - you should be invested in at least 20 companies distributed across various market segments).  But since you will have to pay $7 - $10 in commissions / trade - then you cann&#039;t do that.
        </p> A CD is a very safe way to save. CD stands for Certificicate of Deposit. It means you give the bank the $25,000 and the banlk promises to give you back the $25,000 plus interest at some date in the future (called the maturity date). The term (length of time) can vary from as little as a month to 5 years or more. Rates are historically pretty low right now so you might want to get a short-term CD and renew it at a higher rate when it matures. The CD will be FDIC insured. You might consider putting the money in a Coverdell (eductional) IRA so you do not have to pay taxes on the earnings. But you can only put in so much each year and the money must be used for education. It can still be in a CD even though it is an IRA. Talk to your banker. Good luck.
        </p> If I was you I get a pot put soil plant the 900 dollars and in less that 5 days you ll see the root growing and soon you ll see the progrees
        </p> With Obama and a liberal congress there is no safe way to invest.  They both prefer that everyone spend and only earn income from wages. Anything else will have the bejesus taxed out of it.  Your best bet is to spend it on something that will last like books or go to college.
        </p> I use a jar and I save more money than most. <br>
 <br>
Especially these days - don&#039;t risk it.
        </p> Keep it in your savings account. investing is gambling and in the end you lose. look at all these pathetic morons who lost hundred of thousands of dollars...
        </p> treasury bonds, safest way to go
