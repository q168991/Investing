<h1>How to begin stock investing with a few hundred dollars?</h1>
<div class="answer">Hello, I&amp;#39;m 18 and I&amp;#39;ll be starting college in fall. I have around $600 dollars from graduation gifts and I was wondering if I would be able to begin investing in stocks, and how I would be able to do so. I know that with so little money I won&amp;#39;t be able to buy into any big shares, but I&amp;#39;m interested in trying my hand at the low-stakes &amp;#39;penny stocks&amp;#39;.

I looked into investing a few years ago and if I remember  correctly, it took $500 to even open a portfolio, which I wasn&amp;#39;t able to do at the time. What are the best stock trading venues (websites, etc.) for a beginner in my situation, and how much would it cost to start up?

Although I did have a mock investing portfolio as part of my financial class in high school, I really know next to nothing about investing so any advice would be greatly appreciated. That being said, I&amp;#39;m a pretty intelligent person and I know better than to expect that I&amp;#39;ll become a millionaire or anything — I&amp;#39;ll definitely be smart with my investments.

Thanks!<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> There are many people just like you that are, or were looking to invest and those that did bought Mutual Funds and/or Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).  One purpose of mutual funds is to help investors like you, who are either just entering the investment world or who have no investing experience.  Once you feel you at least have an understanding of investments you should look into ETFs which are similar to mutual funds but are traded on the exchanges. <br>
 <br>
Mutual Fund companies as well as ETFs and Master Limited Partnerships have an entire array of products many will fit your needs. Read about the various products and in doing so you will be getting investment ideas and at the same time educating yourself about investing. <br>
 <br>
You could also contact the funds companies for more information.  I have found that Vanguard (http://***vanguard***/) &amp; Fidelity Investments (https://***fidelity***/) <br>
can meet your needs for mutual funds.  The service and information they provide is all free and you will find it helpful.  You can also read about Master Limited Partnerships at “the Dividend Detective” http://***dividenddetective***/   <br>
 <br>
Regardless of what you decide, do not ever let anyone tell you not to invest, especially those that do not invest themselves. <br>
 <br>
Good luck on your journey

        </p> By no means put your money in a bank, the interest is just too low. Your notion about stocks is entirely unsuitable. You might are attempting a mutual fund, which is a collection of stocks, which evens out rather the spikes and dips of anybody particular stock. Some years ago I put some money into Janus abroad Fund. That did some thing like 40% return the primary year I was once in it, then it dropped for a whilst and went poor for a number of years, then it rebounded once more and i believe final year the return on it was anything like eighty%. Now it is back to being reasonably bad again, however i&#039;m not involved. So if you wish to put your cash into a 1% or 2% financial institution account, go forward, however you would select practically any inventory blindfolded and it would beat the pants off a financial institution over a interval of 5 years or so. Now whilst you provide your cash to a financial institution in a savings account, what do you consider they do with it? Do you think they depart it locked up within the vault? No. They invest it in.... Shares. In the event you fairly are a coward at heart i would endorse ING Direct, which presents online savings debts that can be linked to a bank checking account, so which you can switch money from side to side online. ING can pay a much better rate than any traditional brick-and-mortar financial institution.
        </p> With penny stocks you can make 30 percent or 40 percent profit in a few days. Learn here https://tr.im/learnpennystock <br>
 <br>
The best strategy, if you do have experience type of return on a penny stock, is to sell the stock quickly.  <br>
 <br>
Of course, it’s easier said than done. The natural thing to want when you see an increase in stock price is to hold the stock and hope for an even larger increase.
        </p> When starting out, a low cost s&amp;p 500 index fund is a good way to start. Penny stock are the worst choice to start with. It is rigged, and rife with pump &amp; dump schemes (fraud). $600 is a bit on the low side, a $7 transaction fee would eat up a bit more than 1%. I personally try to not do transactions where the fee is over 1% of the amount of the actual buy/sell. <br>
 <br>
Good fund to start with: <br>
Vanguard Total Stock Market ETF (VTI), <br>
Schwab U.S. Broad Market ETF (SCHB), <br>
iShares Russell 3000 Index (IWV). <br>
 <br>
when you have a bigger budget/more experience you can branch out to less broad index fund or even individual stock. <br>
 <br>
The article linked to below has a lot of information, including suggestions/options for brokers.
        </p> The first thing I would recommend is that you take advantage of a brokerage company with a good introductory promotion to avoid paying the usual fees. Next I would suggest a safer company like Disney (DIS) or Coca Cola (KO) instead of penny stocks.Since you have $600, you can get more than enough shares to start learning the market. <br>
 <br>
If you follow these steps, you or anyone can get 3 FREE trades.  <br>
 <br>
1) Go to scotttrade*** <br>
2) Select: open a new account and begin filling out information <br>
3) Select &quot;referred by a friend&quot; and enter the promo code: XOQL6578 <br>
4) Complete the remaining information needed <br>
 <br>
And then you will have 3 FREE trades my friend (worth $21.00)! <br>
Good luck buddy!
        </p> &quot;I&#039;m a pretty intelligent person&quot;.  That&#039;s good.  But if it&#039;s true, then why are you thinking about penny stock? Penny stock is a scam for lazy or not so intelligent people to lose their money fast.   At your age, you don&#039;t invest in anything.  Just save the little you have.  I can assure you it will be spent on things you need the first week in college. <br>
 <br>
Nobody invests in stock unless they have all their debts paid off, have a good paying job, have six months of income saved, do not expect any debt in the near future and know what they are doing.  You did not pass on at least four of those.  The idea for going to college is that you readily admit you don&#039;t know nothing,  and nothing is going to get in your way, including you,  to learn something.  Good luck.
        </p> Don&#039;t. Trading fees will be high relative to your investment. You also don&#039;t have enough money to be able to diversify your stock portfolio (split your money among a few different stocks).  <br>
 <br>
I&#039;d suggest a mutual fund instead.
        </p> Penny stocks are a very bad idea.  They are gambling, not investing.
