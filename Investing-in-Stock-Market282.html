<h1>Investing in Stock Market?</h1>
<div class="answer">So I just turned 18 and wondering how to invest in stocks. I basically do not know anything about stocks and looking for a mentor or someone to help me understand the concept of investments. Like, step by step, what I would need, resources and etc. I am in it for the long run.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> there&#039;s no way any one can provide you with &quot;a step by step&quot; of what you should do, what you need or the resources you should use within the confined space allotted here on Y.A. <br>
 <br>
But before you spend $0.01 on any investment, you must know what you’re doing, why you’re doing it and how to do it.  Before you invest in any security, the first investment you should make is in yourself, and the best investment you can make is by educating yourself.  <br>
 <br>
Begin your education by learning why you should invest and the importance of being able to make your own decisions or how the pro’s make theirs. Start your education by reading “Investing or Dummies” by Eric Tyson. <br>
To continue your education select some of the following  <br>

Websites that can provide instructions and help with procedures and terminology are Investopedia - http://***investopedia***/ http://***investorshub***/  and 1 Source for Stocks - http://***1source4stocks***/info/stock... or Smart Money  <br>
http://***smartmoney***/ <br>
Visit some of the more professional websites like  Zacks Research - http://***zacks***/ Schaeffer’s http://***schaeffersresearch***/ Investors Business Daily - http://***investors***/default.htm?fromad=1   <br>
Some of these web sites will have advertisers who are worth looking into also. And remember, if they offer free information, get it.   <br>
 <br>
Attend all the free seminars you can, just be careful and don’t get pressured into anything you really don’t want or need. Most schools offer courses in finance and economics, but very few will have courses on the mechanics of the investment markets, if they do try taking the course. You may want to consider on-line courses, the New York Institute of Finance use to have such courses. Try to get some fee information from The stocks exchanges they all have (had) free booklets, SIAC and some of the regulators (FINRA SEC MSRB CBOE) may provide some free literature. <br>
 <br>
And when you think you want to invest/trade, try some paper trading to test your skills without spending you money http://simulatorinvestopedia***/   http://***moneyworks4me***/  <br>
and/or http://***tradingsimulation***/  <br>
 <br>
You at least have made the right decision to start investing, this is the first big step and it won’t be your last. Keep taking those steps forward and along the way never take the advice from people that are not in the market or try to tell you not to invest. <br>
 <br>
Good luck on journey, study hard and you’ll invest well.

</script><p> If you do not know about stock market then you should hire a good stock broker who can transact on behalf of you. I would suggest you to invest in mutual fund first then go for stock market directly
        </p> Stock market investment is very interesting because it&#039;s give good return but most of people loss their money how it is possible? <br>
 <br>
If you stay long time likes more than 15 years you never loss your money and get good return. Early starting is more important because if you have more time your wealth go very high because of compounding.
        </p> Early starting is good for invest in equity market because equity investment need more than 10 years. You have enough time to grow your money.
        </p> The secret word of trading success is &quot;organized&quot;. You can&#039;t be successful without a strategy, a plan and some kind of technological support. I use a software called &quot;autobinary signals&quot; that is helping me a lot. There are plenty of them on the market. I recommend this one because it&#039;s very easy to use (you don&#039;t have to be an expert or have special skills to make money with it). <br>

        </p> Standard investment advice is that you should invest in a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and money market funds.  If you are like most people you will invest part of your money aggressively in stocks, and part conservatively in money market funds and bond funds.  However, some young people will go all stocks, and some very conservative people will go all money markets.  The links below have on-line questionnaires which will give you an idea of how to do &quot;Asset Allocation,&quot; determining how much to put in each type of investment. <br>
  <br>
You want to buy a diversified portfolio of stocks as individual stocks are too risky. Highly knowledgeable people can buy a properly balanced portfolio, but most folks have a difficult time balancing things on their own. They will misbalance their portfolio by buying all small stocks or all growth stocks, or some other misbalanced assortment of stocks.  Back in 2000, Some people bought all Internet stocks; they got burnt when they all crashed together.  You have to diversify across industries.  Unless you know what you are doing, it is best to buy mutual funds that will diversify for you.  Buy no-load, low cost funds.  Mutual funds should have expense ratios of less than 0.5%.   <br>
 <br>
  <br>
 <br>
I like index funds. Because of their broad diversification, you are less likely to have a dramatic drop in value. They also have the lowest management fees. For stock funds, I like putting ~70% of one&#039;s money in the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund. and ~30% in the Vanguard Total International Stock Index Fund. The Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund is good for a bond fund.  The Vanguard Target Retirement funds can be a good all-in-one stock and bond funds for an IRA.   (If you have less than 3,000 dollars, you can&#039;t invest in most Vanguard funds. For such people I would suggest Schwab funds.)  There are many different opinions out there on what the best mutual funds are. Read the links below and form your own opinion. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
  <br>
 <br>
Once you have stared investing, you need to keep adding money on a regular basis.  Many funds allow you to set up automatic investment programs that take a set amount of money out of your bank account each month. <br>
 <br>
If your company offers a 401K plan at work, try to invest the most you can. The money grows tax free, and some companies will match your contribution. Investing in a mutual fund IRA is also a good idea. If you have children, you may want to consider a 529 plan or other college savings plan that grows tax free. <br>
 <br>
  <br>
 <br>
If you have high-interest debt, like credit cards, it is best to pay this off first before trying most of the investment ideas above. You should also have 3-6 months of salary saved up as an emergency fund in a bank or money market fund before trying more risky investments.  <br>
 <br>
I will warn you that there is a tremendous amount of stock investing books and websites that teach stock investing strategies that don&#039;t work.  Particularly bad are people that teach &quot;technical analysis&quot; systems that sound impressive, but don&#039;t work. <br>
 <br>
Believing advice you get on Yahoo answers can be risky, so read these websites for further information. If you find it too confusing, contact a professional financial advisor. They will charge you significant commissions, however.

i have attended a lot of seminars, read counless books on forex trading and it all cost me thousands of dollars. the worst thing was i blew up my first account. after that i opened another account and the same thing happened again. i started to wonder why i couldn,t make any money in forex trading. at first i thought i knew everything about trading. finally i found that the main problem i have was i did not have the right mental in trading. as we know that psychology has great impact on our trading result. apart from psychology issue, there is another problem that we have to address. they are money management, market analysis, and entry/exit rules. to me money management is important in trading. i opened another account and start to trade profitably after i learnt from my past mistake. i don&#039;t trade emotionally anymore.  <br>
if you are serious about trading you need to address your weakness and try to fix it. no forex guru can make you Professional trader unless you want to learn from your mistake.
