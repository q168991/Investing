</script><p> In my opinion a good place to start is at investors***.  If your looking to invest in the stock market this is a good website to start your education.  I would recommend buying the books they have and getting a good grasp of investing before you buy premium services or use hard earned money.  It takes probably a good 2 years of studying the stock market to have a good understanding.  There are websites out there that will allow you to trade in a mock portfolio to help you.  This way you can practice you ideas without risk, but the down side is that you won&#039;t get practice controlling your emotions while trading, and that is when you just jump in with just a little money and working it up to more.   <br>
 <br>
Just take it slow and easy at first.  You don&#039;t have to make a million in your first year.  Make smart trades, follow good investing rule (find them at investors***), and you will do fine.  Hope the website is useful to you and good trading.
        </p> You can buy &quot;Investing For Dummies&quot; at Amazon*** or local bookstores for around $15.  It&#039;s a great starter&#039;s book.
        </p> On this site you find all the details about my favourite binary trading software http://tradingsignal.toptips.org <br>
 <br>
 I like it because it&#039;s very easy to use: NO complex charts… NO baffling analysis... NO complicated methods... in fact nothing to learn at all! Check the site... (the proof videos are interesting)
        </p> Read all the tutorials on investopedia*** (tutorials section).  All of them. <br>
 <br>
Once you&#039;ve done that, you can email me here if you have a question you can&#039;t answer, but expect replies to probably take some time. <br>
 <br>
Yes, all of them.
        </p> the best trading software http://tradingsolution.info <br>
i have attended a lot of seminars, read counless books on forex trading and it all cost me thousands of dollars. the worst thing was i blew up my first account. after that i opened another account and the same thing happened again. i started to wonder why i couldn,t make any money in forex trading. at first i thought i knew everything about trading. finally i found that the main problem i have was i did not have the right mental in trading. as we know that psychology has great impact on our trading result. apart from psychology issue, there is another problem that we have to address. they are money management, market analysis, and entry/exit rules. to me money management is important in trading. i opened another account and start to trade profitably after i learnt from my past mistake. i don&#039;t trade emotionally anymore.  <br>
if you are serious about trading you need to address your weakness and try to fix it. no forex guru can make you Professional trader unless you want to learn from your mistake.
        </p> ?in addition to what everyone said, you can also try http://alpha-investing***/ After you learned the ropes, this site shows you good stocks/mutual funds and tricks on when to pull out.  Good luck.
