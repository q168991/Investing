</script><p> You will never learn to trade or invest successfully from courses, classes in the academic world. <br>
 <br>
To be a trader you must first learn how to invest.  You must know the products and the markets in which they trade and more importantly you must know the rules that govern those products and markets.   <br>
So you must know what you’re doing, why you’re doing it, and how to do it. You should start by reading “Investing for Dummies” by Eric Tyson. <br>
 <br>
Then here’s a list of books you should consider, at least read half of them <br>
Bulls Make Money, Bears Make Money, Pigs Get Slaughtered, by Gallea <br>
How to Trade in Stocks, Jesse Livermore <br>
Millionaire Traders, Lein &amp; Schlosberg <br>
One Up on Wall Street by Peter Lynch <br>
Reminiscences of a Stock Operator, Edwin Lefevre <br>
The Disciplined Trader, Mark Douglas <br>
Trader Vic-Methods of a Wall Street Master, Victor Sperandeo <br>
Trader Vic II-Principles of Professional Speculation, Victor Sperandeo <br>
Trading for a Living, by Alexander Elder <br>
Trading in the Zone, Mark Douglas <br>
 <br>
And when you think you want to trade, try some paper trading to test your skills without spending you money http://simulatorinvestopedia***/   http://***moneyworks4me***/  <br>
and/or http://***tradingsimulation***/ <br>
 <br>
Before you enter your first order you need to address four major policies and have very strong discipline to follow them <br>
1 - You need a written sound trading/investment plan with rules that will not only help you but more importantly protect you, mostly from yourself. Always use stops either to protect you on the down side or to lock in profits on the up side. Never trade on emotions, when emotions get involved walk away.   Don’t try to out-smart the market, you’ll loose but if you always take what the market is willing to give you, you’ll be successful.  Other words, you don’t trade against the trend since the market is always right.  And NEVER trade on emotions, once you let emotions in your trades you will loose <br>
2 - A written money management program is essential. Remember never invest 100% of your capital into any one security and never have 100% of your capital invested.  Never go into a trade without knowing when and where you are going to get out of it.   Never let a loss on a trade get greater than 8%-10%, always take you loss and walk away - don&#039;t loose more than you need to and don&#039;t be afraid to take the loss.  Remember you never can get hurt taking a profit.  Never average down, but you can average up.   <br>
3 - You must have sufficient trading/investment capital. Use your own money, there’s no need to go into debt so that you can trade and/or invest. Margin can be used but only with restraints, never let the account wall below 45% equity.  Unless you fully understand margins you should not use it.   <br>
4 – A full and complete understanding of the rules &amp; regulations of the industry.  If your going to play in the game be sure you know the rules of the game and always follow them. <br>
 <br>
Unless you are willing to study and follow the above you will never make it as a trader.   To be successful as a trader it takes work and constant study of the markets and the products traded in those markets, there is no easy way.

 <br>
A few classic investment books: <br>
 <br>
One Up On Wall Street - Peter Lynch <br>
A Random Walk Down Wall Street - Burton Malkiel <br>
The Intelligent Investor - Benjamin Graham <br>
Securities Analysis - Graham &amp; Dodd
        </p> Binary options let users trade in currency pairs and stocks for various predetermined time-periods, minimal of which is 30 seconds. Executing trades is straightforward. The system uses user-friendly interfaces, which even an 8 years old kid, can operate without having to read any instructions. But winning trades is Not easy.  <br>
Binary trading is advertised as the only genuine system that lets users earn preposterous amounts of money in ridiculously short period of time. Advertisers try to implicate as if you can make $350 every 60 seconds; if it was true then binary trading would truly be an astonishing business.  <br>
However, does it make any sense? Can every trader make tons of money in binary trading? Who is actually paying all the money or the profit to traders?  <br>
The first challenge is finding a trustworthy binary broker; secondly, you need to find a binary trading strategy, which you can use to make profits consistently. Without an effective trading strategy, there is no way you can make money in this business. <br>
Learning a profitable trading strategy is possible, You should watch this presentation video https://tr.im/16635 <br>
It&#039;s probably the best way to learn how to win with binary option
        </p> The skills used for day trading and swing trading are pretty similar.  All these books can help. <br>
In order of importance, these are the skills you&#039;ll need; <br>
1.    Psychology (yours and the market) <br>
2.    Risk management <br>
3.    Technical Analysis (used by most, not needed by some if skills 1 and 2 are used with great ability). <br>
 <br>
Here are two reading lists suggestions. I&#039;ve read about 70% of these; <br>
http://joefahmy***/2010/03/17/recommend...  <br>
http://***chrisperruna***/2010/01/10/2...
        </p> Day Trading For Dummies. About $20 at any bookstore. Even a library may have it. Thank you in advanced for the 20 thumbs down I get. Somehow, unless you are an expert with 20 years experience on here, you get the thumbs down by 2 dozen people. Hope my answer was helpful anyway. I tried day trading. Did not work. Buy and hold works. I gave it my all for a full year. Barely broke even. With all the commission costs.
        </p> Trading binary options online is not as complicated as many people think it is. Read here https://tr.im/tHGvs <br>
 <br>
You don’t have to be an economics expert in order to make money by trading binary options. The charts allow you to predict the future course of an asset by finding patterns in its past price movements, and after all this what we need to win a binary trade. <br>
 <br>
Don&#039;t be intimidated by the charts, actually they are not that hard to read and understand. Strategies that are based on reading and analyzing charts are part of the technical analysis area.
        </p> Penny stocks are prone to violent fluctuation (volatility), many people believe that they&#039;ll luck out with a stock that will jump from $0.08 to $8 in two weeks. And it&#039;s happened. Learn here https://tr.im/wswo5  <br>
 <br>
Scour enough investing message boards and you&#039;re sure to find success stories from investors who made a mint while &quot;playing the pennies.&quot; <br>
 <br>
Companies that can successfully make the jump from penny stock to power stock are rare, but when you find them they pay out in spades. Numbers vary quite a bit in the penny stock world, but investors have raked in gains over 1,000% in a couple weeks&#039; time. The real trick is finding the right stock.
