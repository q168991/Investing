</script><p> If you have some savings that you will not need to touch for a long time.  I definitely recommend that you start investing.  Learning these skills at an early age will definitely give you a head start in life. <br>
 <br>
***fidelity*** is a great place to start to learn about investing.  It is a great source for mutual funds.  Also yahoo Finance has lots of articles that are very informative and educational. <br>
 <br>
Take your time you are in no hurry and do your homework.

</script><p> Hi Andy, to my knowledge when you buy or sell stock or mutual funds you are entering into a binding contract.  You probably won&#039;t be able to invest directly until you are 18.   <br>
That being said, there are a few ways to invest when you are 14.  You can always do a high interest saving account.  If you have a job (paper route, babysitting, odd jobs) you can file an income tax return.  This will do a few great things.  1) you will end up getting a tax return  2) you will be able to contribute money into an RRSP - you can contribut 18% of your annual earnings plus an extra $2000 without penelty.  Here&#039;s the kicker - your RRSP will be with a bank or investment firm and will be invested in mutual funds (get your parents to help you as they could probably use this too...lol)  3)  you can claim the money you put in your RRSP as a tax deduction.  If I were you I would contribute as much as possible and claim the deductions when you older (in your 20&#039;s or 30&#039;s)and paying higher taxes. <br>
Even if you get a modest 7.2% return, your money will double every 10 years on that single investment.  You can also use your RRSP&#039;s to buy a house or go to school however there are better ways to do that. (RRSPs are a tool that should be used for retirement)  I highly recommend you get a financial advisor once you turn 18.  Someone with your interest in money will benefit from this professional advice - and it won&#039;t cost you anything out of pocket.  Good luck Andy
        </p> Assuming that you are in the USA, you can start a Coverdell Education Savings Account at Scottrade, with a parent or guardian as custodian of course. <br>
 <br>
You can deposit a maximum of $2,000 per year. <br>
 <br>
All the gains are tax free when used for higher education. <br>
 <br>
I use Scottrade because they charge no fees to maintain the account, and you can invest in stocks, mutual funds and bonds. The price of a limit trade is only $7. <br>
 <br>
I have my children&#039;s Coverdell account at Scottrade, and most of it is in the Excellsior Real Estate Fund, which has been making over 20% per year. There is a $250 minimum initial purchase, and $100 subsequent purchases. You have to hold it at least 6 months or face an early sale penalty. There is no load and no transaction fee for this fund at Scottrade. <br>
 <br>
Now I know what you are probably thinking, you want to make money you can spend, not for college. But consider this, won&#039;t you have more spending money, if you use this to pay for your college fees? <br>
 <br>
Good luck to you in all your investments. <br>
 <br>
FYI: <br>
 <br>
If you were to deposit $2,000 per year into this account, at 20% per year, simple interest, by age 18, you will have deposited $10,000, and made $5,712 in gains. <br>
 <br>
By age 21, you will have deposited $16,000, and made $18,431 in gains. <br>
 <br>
By age 25, you will have deposited $24,000, and made $58,133. <br>
 <br>
By age 30, you will have deposited $34,000, and made $185,256 in tax free gains. <br>
 <br>
Coverdells have be closed out by age 30.
        </p> I would say you should start off with an S&amp;P 500 index fund. They aren&#039;t sexy but when you don&#039;t have a lot of money they make the most sense. Your obviously can&#039;t have an account by yourself, so just go with which ever company your parents are comfortable with. However, I would recommend a discount broker for now. You will need at least $1000 to begin investing.
        </p> I am personally a fan of Banc Of America as they have a terrific investment services department. Their fees are alot lower than most firms, including the awful Merrill Lynch, yet provide industry leading advisors, funds, etc. If your parents invest or are interested, you should talk to a person who works at this bank, which is the larget financial institution in the world. Hopefully, this helps you.
        </p> Good for you for wanting to invest early.  Typically though, you can&#039;t invest the money yourself until you have reached age 18.  Your parents will need to assist you in doing this. <br>
 <br>
There are lots of ways to learn about mutual funds and investing.  A couple of good sources are Morningstar and Motley Fool.
        </p> You can have a parent or responsible adult open an account for you titled &quot;Whatever.Their.Name.Is FBO Andy&quot;, (the FBO means &quot;for the benefit of&quot;) and start regularly buying small amounts of popular common stocks.  (I like ***buyandhold*** or ***sharebuilder***, because they are VERY cheap, and encourage the &quot;right kind&quot; of investing) <br>
 <br>
If you regularly invest as little as $10 a week starting at your age, you will almost be a millionaire (~$800,000) by retirement age even if you kept only putting $10 a week away after you start a full-time job! <br>
 <br>
Read a lot, learn a lot, think for yourself....you can be rich AND happy!
        </p> schwab*** can handle stocks + many mutual funds. Vanguard &amp; Fildelity can do mutual funds. Start now.
        </p> TD Ameritrade.
