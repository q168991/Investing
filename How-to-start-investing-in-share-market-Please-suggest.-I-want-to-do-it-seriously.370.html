</script><p> It seems like you want to become a day trader. Day trading is a very difficult and very, very stressful job. It is by no means &#039;free&#039; or &#039;easy&#039; money. In all honesty, you would be better off at your old job, as it least offers a guaranteed income.

</script><p> Investing in share market can get you a very good amount of money provided you do it sensibly. If you do it under pressure that your earnings depend on it you might take some wrong emotional decisions. I believe in investing with a goal of say 20% compounded growth each year. Anything above that is welcome. For this purpose invest in companies with strong fundamentals and at the right time buy and sell the stocks. You must study a lot and have a virtual portfolio before you put your money into it. If you spend some time investing you wil increase your base capital and then probably you will get enough to live on. Trading as a profession is dangerous if your investment gets wiped out you will have no income left.
        </p> Never buy single stocks, that is, stocks in a single company. There is no difference between single stocks and gambling. Invest in mutual funds or money markets. They have averaged 10% + over the last 70 years with much less risk than traditional stocks.
        </p> What you are talking about is active trading.  <br>
 <br>
If the stock market is in a stage of momentum trading with high volumes it is possible to do this, but it like going to Las Vegas casinos to make money. Most likely, unless you are a genius (or you have insider information which is illegal) you will fail and lose money instead. <br>
 <br>
It is possible to make money through active trading to take advantage of very small market inefficiencies, but that would require large sums and money with leverage. This is what hedge funds do. That is way outside of your range. <br>
 <br>
I would strongly suggest that you look for another way of making money unless you have friends in very high positions in big global corporations.
        </p> Stocks (share market) should not be used to supplement your monthy salary. If you are out of a job, I strongly recommend holding off on the share market. In difficult times, cash is king and should be treated as such. Your efforts should be concentrated on looking for a new job and having enough cash on hand until you find a new job.
        </p> Yes you can, look into a company called Better Trades, they have a website you can visit and free seminars. It will cost you money but they have made a lot of people money trading in the markets, they have one of the best systems out there. Markay Latimar is one of there instructors that you will make the most from if you follow her teachings. Good luck
        </p> yes you can invest... but be wise and observe the markets.   <br>
 <br>
Since you are a beginner I would like to suggest gnutrade an excellent trading platform.here you can have lots of features and benefits.
        </p> Yeah sure...you can start with 10000Rs if you have this spare money coz it is like a roller-coaster and it is not essential that you will get day to day earning. So first you need to keep yourself updated with the latest information updated .Keep following this website:
        </p> Day trading is risky that too for a beginner. <br>
You have to get sufficient knowledge before you start. Read business papers, and see business tv channels and get knowledge. <br>
Till that time go thro the mutual funds.
        </p> its my request not to go in day trading.spouse u ve spare money 10000 then invest 3000 know in gud stocks,2000 in mutual funds.hold 5000nfor other correction

         hey yes true...that guy referred an excellent trading platform.  Yes gnutrade is an wonderful website for a beginner to start with.  go ahead \ <br>
 <br>
all the best
        </p> You can start with any amount. <br>
 <br>
But it is very tricky out there. As a beginner you may even drain your capital.
        </p> you can start with 10k. but dont expect huge returns. first learn the basics. then invest. dont trade. <br>
