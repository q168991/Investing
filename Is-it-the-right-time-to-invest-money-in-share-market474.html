</script><p> Hi, <br>
 <br>
Ya you can invest in the stocks as most of the stocks are at their low and still dropping. Track the markets regularly and when the trend of the market looks changing, invest. <br>
 <br>
Principles of investing are: <br>
 <br>
1. Invest if and only the investing amount is excess and of no use for 2-3 years. <br>
 <br>
2. Do not put all you eggs into one basket. <br>
 <br>
3. Diversify your investments. <br>
 <br>
4. Do not panic if the market are going down. <br>
 <br>
5. Track the stocks from time to time and reap profits. <br>
