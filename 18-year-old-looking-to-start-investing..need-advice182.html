</script><p> You already lost, your thinking like your gonna get rich fast.  I&#039;m 21 started trading at 19, you don&#039;t get rich, the best you can hope for is just grow slowly.  My friends and brothers all lost major bucks because they got greedy.  I wasn&#039;t greedy, but I didn&#039;t know what the heck I was doing either.  I just took it slow thought about what the other players were thinking; and now I make more then the pros by percentage lol.  I do get lost in the game sometimes, I have to tell myself I&#039;m still a novice and I shouldn&#039;t get to happy when I make a few bucks here and there.  My advice take some more time to think about trading stocks, your too hyped up about making money.  We got all the time in the world to learn about trading, but it takes seconds to lose money.
