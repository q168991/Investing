<h1>Too late to invest in TIPS?</h1>
<div class="answer">I believe inflation in the United States will continue to rise for years to come, because rising fuel prices cause the prices of everything else to rise. I have been considering investing in Treasury Inflation Protected Securities (TIPS) as a safe haven for a chunk of money. But now I read that Morningstar has said that the yields on TIPS have gotten so low, that even the fact they&amp;#39;re inflation protected makes them a poor investment at this time. In essence, it&amp;#39;s too late to buy them. I&amp;#39;m not sure I agree, given my assumption that inflation is here to stay for a long time. What do you think?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Morningstar has a valid point.  I think the rate is 1%.  This of course is thanks to the Fed which is more interested in bailing out fools that made bad investments than in protecting the savings of people that didn&#039;t.  Typical Washington stupidity, but then if we did not hear Washington and stupidity in the same sentence, it would be an oxymoron. <br>
 <br>
On the other hand it might very well be 4% 10 year bonds by a wide margin assuming the consumer price index fairly represented inflation which it does not.  The government likes to lie.  <br>
 <br>
If you are willing to take some additional risk, you can get 7% return plus some expected capital appreciation by investing your money in pipeline limitied partnerships.  The dividend is subject to state and local taxes if it is held outside of a Roth IRA.  <br>
 <br>
ETP pays 7.5% and has a 5 year annual return of 32%.  Ten year annual return of 24% <br>
 <br>
MMP pays 7.3% and has a 5 year annual return of 16.5% <br>
 <br>
PAA pays 7.3% and has a 5 year annual return of 16.2% <br>
 <br>
Beats the crap out of those worthless government bonds.

</script><p> I bought TIPs recently.  I have zero confidence that inflation is contained - the price of food and oil is working its way into every day life.   Everything will go up in price.  Plus the Fed is printing money and Bernanke is using a helicopter to drop wads of cash on Wall Street. And you think 3% inflation is high??
        </p> Real inflation is over 16%.  <br>
 <br>
The mad scientists at the Fed are imposing a stealth tax. <br>
 <br>
Try reading a chart outside of the government&#039;s influence, will ya?
        </p> It sort of depends on what YOU want and expect. Morningstar and such are fond of sifting and sorting to make lists. They have the resources to compare a wider spectrum than we mere mortals could on our own. <br>
 <br>
If you aren&#039;t trying to find THE biggest, best, or flashiest, etc. Then TIPS are open, available, and uncommonly easy ways to safely stash some cash for the future: http://***treasurydirect.gov/indiv/prod...
