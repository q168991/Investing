</script><p> Real estate is a concentrated risk, it&#039;s a high proportion of your net worth that you&#039;re investing and if it pans out then great but if it doesn&#039;t then tough.   One thing about investing is that it is placing your money at risk.    <br>
 <br>
A game theory example would be if you had the opportunity to wager on fair coin tosses with a payout of 2 to 1, that is if you win, you win twice your wager plus your wager is returned to you but if you lose, you lose your wager.   Now it&#039;s clear that if you wager nothing, you risk nothing and you will gain nothing and it&#039;s also clear that if you wager everything that you have, although you stand to gain the most when you win, you will lose everything when you lose.   So what is the optimal fraction of your money to place at risk?   With the coin toss, that can be calculated and it&#039;s 25%.   With real life investments, the outcomes and probabilities can only be estimated so it&#039;s much harder and requires some judgement to determine how much you should risk but it&#039;s definitely not everything. <br>
 <br>
With real estate, it&#039;s far too easy to risk too much.   For some the risk pans out so there are plenty of success stories but over betting is a sure way to ruin good investment opportunities and in reality, real estate produces more horror stories that you never hear about then success stories.   However there are ways to limit your risk, such as REIT&#039;s. <br>
 <br>
Stocks is the same situation, it&#039;s quite easy to over bet but it&#039;s also very easy to be conservative with stocks and assure a reasonable outcome. <br>
 <br>
Starting a business has tremendous return potential, the retail business model is typically a 40% markup so if it takes a year to move stock, and neglecting operating expenses, you have a 40% return.   But businesses take effort.   Stocks are investing in the efforts of others, you share a small part of another entrepreneurs gains without having to contribute the work.   With your own business, you&#039;ll find that all the work comes from you and indeed most entrepreneurs work years on end for what amounts to pennies per hour just to keep their businesses alive. <br>
 <br>
The easiest would be to just invest in a no load, low fee mutual fund and contribute every month.   The fund manager will select the stock and rebalance the portfolio whenever the market changes dramatically and you just have to keep contributing.   Max out any tax shelters you may have access to, over 40 years, the difference can be a factor of two or three.   If your employer offers a match on their 401k, max that out as it&#039;s an immediate certain return on investment.   Most 401k&#039;s offer inferior high fee mutual fund choices so after meeting the employer&#039;s match, max out your IRA instead then go back to contributing additional funds to the 401k if you still have surplus income to invest.   If you&#039;ve maxed out both the $5,000 per year contribution limit to your IRA and the $16,500 401k contribution limit then you contribute to a brokerage account which is not tax sheltered however you can leverage it to effectively extend the tax shelter by holding municipal bonds and long term growth stocks which do not generate annual taxable income in your brokerage account and keep your portfolio rebalance point in your tax sheltered accounts. <br>
 <br>
Your biggest challenge will be yourself, a lot will happen in the next 40 to 50 years and it may seem justified to withdraw from your investments or to cease contributing for various reasons, well it&#039;s not.   You should file for bankruptcy before you even remotely consider touch funds in any tax shelters cause retirement funds are the one thing they won&#039;t take away from you in a bankruptcy.   Let your friends sit in jail rather than withdraw to pay bail, at least that way they get a public defender.   If a girlfriend starts yammering about needing a coach bag or the latest iphone then give her a grocery bag and send her packing.   You want to help your friends or buy your girlfriend stuff then make a budget for spending and a budget for charity as well as a budget for saving and a budget for investing.   The spending will be for things that are nice to have and to buy such as stuff for your girlfriend, the charity is for helping people such as bailing your friends out and the savings is your emergency account and the emergency must be very dire in order to consider touching it.   Never consider touching the investment budget for anything other than investment.   If there isn&#039;t enough in one of the other categories then you can&#039;t afford it, plain and simple.

</script><p> Good! You&#039;re only 18, thinking of the future and investment, and most of all, not greedy. A lot of people are hoping for a get rich tomorrow method but you are very conservative. Good! $900 is not a bad amount to start. How about invest in GE, only of the biggest companies in the world, pays dividend $0.60 per share annually. At it&#039;s current price, you are able to acquire 50 shares. Instead of putting the money in the bank collecting next to nothing, invest in a conservative, conventional industry. Go open an online trading account with a brokerage and you should be able to do your purchase. By the way, I do not work for GE and I am not a stock broker.
        </p> The easiest are mutual funds and ETFs. They are already diversified investment vehicles. They can contain funds from stocks, real estate investment trusts, and others. There are many different types that can fit different investing wants and needs with varying risk levels and profits.
        </p> At your young age you should be able to handle more risk. <br>
Therefore, try mutual funds such as small caps and global <br>
growth and sector funds. It is important that you use the <br>
Roth IRA with your investments. Investment companies that <br>
are good to go with. Fidelity, Vanguard, American Century <br>
Lots of luck
        </p>
