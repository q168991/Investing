Some good books on the basics: <br>
&quot;How To Buy Stocks&quot; by Louis Engel and Henry R. Hecht. <br>

Stock Picking <br>
How Charts Can Help You In The Stock Market <br>
Guide To The Markets <br>
When The Market Moves Will You Be Ready <br>
 <br>
Open a brokerage account with a firm that allows online trading such as Scottrade and deposit funds in your account. <br>
Once you open an account you will have access to the research sources available through your brokerage firm. <br>
Familiarize yourself with your accounts trading platform before making your first trade.
        </p> i would suggest doing trades on paper, you simply research stocks and when you have found one that you feel is going to go up write down the name and price that you imaginatively bought at and then when you feel it is time to sell right that price down. Then find the difference in price as a percent to see how you did. This approach would be best since you really don&#039;t want to be learning the ropes per say right now with your hard earned money at stake. Also read Way of the Turtle for basic trading strategy and/ or Ugly American which is a fiction novel which will provide little educational value on investing but is a great read based on real life investing
        </p> Do you want to start investing, or do you just want knowledge?  I will assume you want to start investing.   <br>
First and foremost, you must always remember that the stock market is volatile.  It goes up and down on an almost constant daily basis.  However, if you look at the market over a long-term period, such as 20 years, it goes up.  In almost every case and period of its history, it goes up.   <br>
Next, do not look at &quot;Flavor-of-the-Week&quot; stock picks.  If you use a broker who recommends different stocks to you every week or month, then he is just trying to sell you something.  When it comes to picking stocks, when you just start out, pick what you know.  Do you like Coke or Pepsi?  If you like Coke better, then buy their stock.  Do your kids go nuts over Hannah Montana and High School Musical, then buy Disney.   <br>
Lastly, if you want to buy stocks in things you do not know, then do your homework before you buy any stock.  Look up companies websites.  Find out what they do well, and what they do not do well.  You would not give your money to a stranger just because he promised to turn you a profit.  Do not give your money to a company without researching them first. <br>
 <br>
I hope this helps.  I am not a high volume investor, but I have been paying attention, not getting too excited and doing my research.  I know people who would give their right arms to have only lost the little bit that I have this year.  And do not kid yourself, EVERYONE has lost money this year.  If someone tries to tell you different, then they are either fooling themselves or just trying to fool you.  Good luck again.
        </p> The risk is dependent upon the &quot;asset allocation&quot; plan. As a general rule, banks and Insurance companies are a terrible place for investment products.... high fees and poor advice are a common thread. HOWEVER: Some banks do have a different department take care of High Worth clients. Some of them are exceptional.... others are mediocre or worse. I wouldn&#039;t consider you a high net worth client unless you had 3-5 million dollars. What ever you choose... it still depends on the &quot;asset allocation&quot; model you and the bank agree on. Keep in mind... the fees for these services are generally high. I would read some books on general investing and Mutual Funds before committing my money. Most of us, with some knowledge can do as well or better than these &quot;experts&quot; with much less costs... but at the very least... know enough to know if you&#039;re being screwed.
        </p> Binary options let users trade in currency pairs and stocks for various predetermined time-periods, minimal of which is 30 seconds. Executing trades is straightforward. The system uses user-friendly interfaces, which even an 8 years old kid, can operate without having to read any instructions. But winning trades is Not easy.  <br>
Binary trading is advertised as the only genuine system that lets users earn preposterous amounts of money in ridiculously short period of time. Advertisers try to implicate as if you can make $350 every 60 seconds; if it was true then binary trading would truly be an astonishing business.  <br>
However, does it make any sense? Can every trader make tons of money in binary trading? Who is actually paying all the money or the profit to traders?  <br>
The first challenge is finding a trustworthy binary broker; secondly, you need to find a binary trading strategy, which you can use to make profits consistently. Without an effective trading strategy, there is no way you can make money in this business. <br>
Learning a profitable trading strategy is possible, You should watch this presentation video https://tr.im/16635 <br>
It&#039;s probably the best way to learn how to win with binary option
        </p> I&#039;ve been trading the market for just a few months. My cousin actually told me about this website ( http://pennystocks.toptips.org ) and I signed up immediately after. This is my honest review about their method. I&#039;m not someone who has a lot of time to be researching for ideas because I work many hours. they made it incredibly easy for me to make money in the market. Their reports are easy to read and follow. I&#039;ve tracked most of the stock ideas that I&#039;ve received in my e-mail from them and MANY have seen some nice gains after their announcements. I&#039;ve made a nice profit (55% return on my investment on one, and 112% on the other!) on a couple of suggestions he&#039;s given and plan to start trading his ideas a lot more.  <br>

        </p> I think the best way to invest in the stock market is to go with index funds.  You cannot buy an index directly, but you can get mutual funds that try to go exactly with the index.  The dow jones wilshire 5000 is the safest index fund out there because it is every stock in the United States.  Check it out: https://***etrade.wallst***/v1/stocks/... <br>
This mutual fund goes with the index as best as it can. <br>
 <br>
This is also a no load, no transaction fee mutual fund. <br>
 <br>
When the market turns bull again, I would put more money in some good bonds.
        </p> The Motley Fool is a group that writes a column on investing for the newspapers. ***fool*** (not my website) tells you what to do to get started.  Go to ***scottrade*** to see where you buy and sell the stocks..
