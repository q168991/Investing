<h1>Is investing for dummies by eric tyson worth even looking at?</h1>
<div class="answer">I just picked up investing for dummies by eric Tyson, and the first thing I did was to see what it had to teach about options. I look at the table of contents, and see nothing about options, until I finally run into a little section that says STEER CLEAR OF OPTIONS AND FUTURES. then I proceed to read the section, which was about less than a page, and ALL it had to say was that don&amp;#39;t trade options because you can lose your premium and make nothing. 

I recently graduated from college with a finance degree, I am a risk taker, I find myself much smarter than the average person/investor and this book tells me and everyone who thinks like me NOT to take risks. risks MUST be taken for great wealth to be acquired. 

My question is, is this book meant to teach people some basic investing ideas for actual DUMMIES, so they don&amp;#39;t go waste their money, or would Warren Buffett say the same thing, steer clear of options? I basically have decided not to read any more of the book, and without knowing Eric Tyson, have lost all respect for the man. Please tell me what you think. I am a person who is trying to model my investing habits after the Trumps and the Buffetts of this world, SHOULD ANY ENTREPRENEUR BOTHER READING A BOOK THAT TELLS YOU NOT TO TAKE RISKS? is this book worth anything, or a waste of 500 pages?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

        </p> After being an investor for over 23 years in mutual funds I have <br>
made a profit of 8-9% only because I bought in as the stock market <br>
was on a good rise. Then came the internet dot com bubble when <br>
the Dow Jones was over 14,000. That was more than 10 years ago <br>
and the Dow never got that high again. I survived another big dip <br>
in 2007-2008 on the housing/banking bubble where I put more into <br>
my mutual funds. Believe me it took a lot of balls for me to do some- <br>
thing like that. Now I have to sweat out this debt crises. So as you <br>
can see, its not easy.
        </p> Since 80% of people lose money when they buy options, this is a good reason to avoid them. If you want to sell options and collect the premium, that is the prudent side to play. Investing for Dummies is targeted at beginners, not for those of us with more than a few battle scars...
        </p> The book is targeted at people who want to learn the basics and foundations of trading on the stock market.  It is not intended to be a textbook for advanced traders - which are what options traders are, they are advanced. <br>
 <br>
Most, if not all, brokerages do not allow option trading for beginners until they have amassed some degree of experience ( and assets ).  And there are plenty of books written on the various areas of options like the Greeks,  Black Scholes,  etc. <br>
 <br>
Since you consider yourself  &quot;smarter than the average person&quot;,  this book is very obviously not for you.  There is no reason to criticize the book on that basis.
        </p> In binary options you will have the possibility to predict the movement of various assets such as stocks, currency pairs, commodities and indices. Learn how you can make money trading binary options https://tinyurl.im/aH5Du An option has only two outcomes (hence the name &quot;binary&quot; options). This is because the value of an asset can only go up or down during a given time frame. Your task will be to predict if the value of an asset with either go up or down during a certain amount of time.
        </p> The book title actually tells you why there is not much in it about options.  The key word is &quot;investing&quot;.  When you buy options you are speculating on investing.  I don&#039;t know if there is a book &quot;Speculating for Dummies&quot; or not.   <br>
 <br>
Yes that is a pretty decent book about the basics of investing.  There are probably another 1000 titles also about investing the don&#039;t even mention options at all.

         Penny stocks are prone to violent fluctuation (volatility), many people believe that they&#039;ll luck out with a stock that will jump from $0.08 to $8 in two weeks. And it&#039;s happened. Learn here https://tr.im/N425p  <br>
 <br>
Scour enough investing message boards and you&#039;re sure to find success stories from investors who made a mint while &quot;playing the pennies.&quot; <br>
 <br>
Companies that can successfully make the jump from penny stock to power stock are rare, but when you find them they pay out in spades. Numbers vary quite a bit in the penny stock world, but investors have raked in gains over 1,000% in a couple weeks&#039; time. The real trick is finding the right stock.
        </p> Trading binary options online is not as complicated as many people think it is. Read here https://tr.im/9BiuM <br>
 <br>
You don’t have to be an economics expert in order to make money by trading binary options. The charts allow you to predict the future course of an asset by finding patterns in its past price movements, and after all this what we need to win a binary trade. <br>
 <br>
Don&#039;t be intimidated by the charts, actually they are not that hard to read and understand. Strategies that are based on reading and analyzing charts are part of the technical analysis area.
