<h1>Would you invest in a stock for a small private tech company?</h1>
<div class="answer">I&amp;#39;m being offered a job -- very low paid, exception they want me to buy their common stock subscription to make up for the low salary. However, this tech company is not some Yahoo, Google, or Microsoft, but a very tiny 3-5 person company. They are hoping to build a product that&amp;#39;s so great, that hopefully it will be bought out and then hoping the shares will be worth something.

Now, since this is a private company (not listed on the stock exchange), how will I even sell it on the open market? It&amp;#39;s like, &amp;quot;Hey, does anyone want to buy Bob&amp;#39;s IT shop stock or Google stock?&amp;quot; But since stock are an asset, will I be taxed on it, or taxed after I cash it out?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
