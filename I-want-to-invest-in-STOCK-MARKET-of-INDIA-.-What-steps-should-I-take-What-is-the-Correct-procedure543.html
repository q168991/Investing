</script><p> First and foremost: SEBI is a regulatory body in stock market space. So you can not invest in SEBI. <br>
 <br>
If you wish to invest in stock markets: <br>
 <br>
1. If you wish to invest in the markets itself i.e. BSE / NSE etc. , it is not possible. Both the markets are not still listed on any exchanges. You can look for the BSE shares ( privately placed by people). But you won&#039;t find any quotes etc on markets. Don&#039;t do this is my frank suggestion. <br>
 <br>
2. You wish to buy and sell shares of various companies on Stock Markets. This is most common and regular investment avenue. Most probably you wish to do this. <br>
 <br>
For this you must have following accounts opened on your name. <br>
 <br>
Bank Account:  <br>
you will keep your money / savings here. When you buy shares you will issue a cheque from this account and when you sell you will get credits directly in this account or you will get cheque which you will deposit in this account. Most probably this will be a Savings Bank (SB) account with cheque facility. <br>
 <br>
Demat Account: <br>
When you buy shares from the stock markets, you will get shares in demat format. These shares will be credited to this account. When you sell shares, you will issue DIS and sold shares will be debited from this account. You can transfer the shares to other people from this account, too. <br>
 <br>
Trading Account: <br>
All your buy and sell trades will be effected in this account. All share transactions will be in this account. <br>
 <br>
If you can link all three accounts to each other, you won&#039;t find it difficult as everything ( movement of shares and money ) is automatic. Few banks and share brokers offer such services. Else you can have a demat account and trading account with a same broker for easy share movement and trading. <br>
 <br>
Please enquire and collect information about opening of accounts from few brokers near by you. Tabulate it and then choose for the share broker / service provider. Take into account charges for opening accounts , yearly fees, brokerage charged etc. <br>
 <br>
Wish you all the money in the markets. In case you wish to know when ever you wish, please feel free to ask relevant questions in this forum or email me. Am in the same field for years.

</script><p> How To Invest In Share Market In India
        </p> The first step toward investing in Indian stock market is to open a bank account. A bank account is required to hold your funds that you will be investing. <br>
 <br>
 Just like bank account is required to hold your funds, a Demat account is required to hold your assets such as equities, debentures and mutual funds. <br>
 <br>
 A trading/brokerage account lets you purchase stocks, bonds, mutual funds, and other units by paying the broker to do the trading on your behalf. You would not be able to do trading without a trading account. For your convenience,banks have started providing all these services in a single unified account. <br>
  <br>
In order to make profits, have a sound understanding of all the concepts of the market. <br>
 <br>
Determine How Much You Can Invest <br>
 <br>
Develop A Strategy to earn more profit.
        </p> Since you lack experience in stock selection and assuming you do not live in India, it is difficult to buy India stocks from other countries.  However, here in the US, you now have access to &quot;Power Shares India&quot; symbol is PIN.  This is an exchange traded fund.   It makes it easy to buy one security that owns all of the major stocks in India.  It trades throughout the trading day (8:30 am to 3 pm Central Daylight Time).  The commission to buy is dictated by the brokerage firm you buy it from.  At Fidelity, the fee is $7.95 per trade.  There are also several other India investments available in the US, but PIN would be my choice.
        </p> Be patient, Go for any stock brokers nearer, like geojit finance, sharekhan,reliancemoney,indiabulls, religare etc, I prefer geojit. apply for PAN, then DEMAT account, It takes nearly 2 months. During this, study market. Invest in leading stocks. Invest some money in insurance like Reliance Insurance. Its good. Be a long term investor, ALL THE BEST.
        </p> You can approach a share broking company Viz. Geojit Securities, Aditya Birla Money, Steel City Securities, Karvy Consultants, etc etc.  You can open a Demat Account with them.  For that you should have Pan No. In addition to copy of the Pan No, 3 passport size photos and xeros copies of Bank Pass Book, and a Cancelled Cheque Leaf of your account, xeros copies of address proof such as passport, driving license, voter&#039;s identity card with your photo affixed are to be furnished to the stock broking company.  The broker will advise you charges for opening and yearly charges and charges for daily trading and also for taking delivery of stocks.   <br>
 <br>
SEBI is not a stock broker.  It is the regulator of stock markets.  Hence you cannot invest in SEBI.
        </p> I may be too late to answer this question. If you are still wondering how to start trading and not yet figured out then I can have a way out for you.  <br>

Do contact me at mehulnandani@rediffmail*** if you are interested.
        </p> Visit a Broker of repute and you will be guided. <br>
You must be having friends and associates engaged in investments in Stock Market. <br>
Take their advice and act. <br>
Be prudent, do delivery based transactions and not future, options, call and put transactions which is all greek &amp; latin to you. <br>
Are you in Mumbai?? If you need assistance - do revert back.  <br>
Do not be tempted by opportunities that may prove fraudulent.
        </p> First of All, open a New Account with any reliable broker. Then learn the basic art of trading and investment. Then do some paper trading and eventually can trade and invest with your money with proper discipline and money management.
        </p> Here you go. <br>
 <br>
1. Get PAN card (requires permanent address like electricity bill, Driving license, passport etc) 15 days approx <br>
2. Open a bank account with one of the leading banks like HDFC, Axis, IDBI, ICICI etc (These banks will allow online linkage of your trading account with your bank account) One week time Approx <br>
3. Approach one of the brokerage firms to open your demat account and trading account. These days most of the big bank including SBI, HDFC, ICICI have facility of opening demat account. One week Time approx <br>
4. Open Online trading account or regular account depending on your wish. One week time approx <br>
5. Start trading by self using online tool provided by your brokerage firm or by calling your broker over phone or by using phone trading (Exact term I dont remember). Immediate during market hrs. <br>
 <br>
Total time is about 1 mths <br>
 <br>
If you stay abroad then u might want to try with ICICI. They are expensive but less hassle. <br>
For Indian resident <br>

My Recommended bank account - HDFC, AXIS <br>
