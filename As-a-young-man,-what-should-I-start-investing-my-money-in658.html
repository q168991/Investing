<h1>As a young man, what should I start investing my money in?</h1>
<div class="answer">I&amp;#39;m a 21 one year old male looking to invest my money in something new. I have a savings account with about $6,000 that both my father and I have put money in. I have a debit account with about $900. I&amp;#39;m looking for something new to invest in. Should I invest in stocks, manage a portfolio, or a cd? I&amp;#39;m not really sure what to do, so any recommendations would be helpful!<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> First off, you should be commended for thinking about your financial future - many people wait until much later in life, only to realize that they should have started years ago. <br>
 <br>
What you should invest in depends largely on how long you plan to have your money invested.  For example, if you plan to use the money in five years to buy a house, you&#039;ll want a very different type of investment than if you want to invest for retirement (40 years or more). <br>
 <br>
Your first investment should be in education.  Not school, necessarily, but at least pick up one or two books on the basics of investing.  There you&#039;ll learn important concepts like risk/reward spectrum, mutual funds, types of investment accounts (the advantages/disadvantages of IRA&#039;s), stocks, bonds, investing strategies, etc.  This stuff isn&#039;t all that complicated, but it is VERY important to know.  You are young - you will have decades to put this valuable knowledge to work for you. <br>
 <br>
I hope that helps.  Good luck, and again - kudos for getting started early.  I guarantee you&#039;ll be glad you did.

</script><p> Quite a few things. <br>
 <br>
1)  I encourage you to contact an investment firm like Northwestern Mutual to set up a Roth IRA and/or mutual fund.  Meeting with financial advisors is free because they get very small percentages of portfolio worth.  This way, they help you and teach you for free before you ever spend a dime. <br>
2)  Create a seperate savings account for long-term goals like a house down payment, or car payment but easily accessible (as a 401(k) and IRA and Mutual Fund are less accessible for fast cash. <br>
3)  I would not waste too much money in the stock game until you are more educated as you may quickly loose all you and your dad have saved. <br>
 <br>
Be patient, do your research until you&#039;re not learning anything new, and then invest.  At your age, I would encourage beginning a retirement account like a Roth IRA, increase your contributions to your employers 401(k) if you&#039;re working, start a mutual fund (typically 2 or 3k minimums, which is just a blend of stocks for safety cushions), and start a seperate savings account. <br>
 <br>
Also, take a look at some investment calculator websites and see how investing now can truly make a difference over the next 47 years rather than starting in 5-10 years. <br>
 <br>
You may also want to use some of that cash to start a side business, like photography or a website.  If you have a passion, now is the time to get the equipment so you can benefit from it for the rest of your life.
        </p> Standard investment advice is that you should invest in a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and money market funds.  If you are like most people you will invest part of your money aggressively in stocks, and part conservatively in money market funds and bond funds.  However, some young people will go all stocks, and some very conservative people will go all money markets.  The links below have on-line questionnaires which will give you an idea of how to do &quot;Asset Allocation,&quot; determining how much to put in each type of investment. <br>
  <br>
You want to buy a diversified portfolio of stocks as individual stocks are too risky. Highly knowledgeable people can buy a properly balanced portfolio, but most folks have a difficult time balancing things on their own. They will misbalance their portfolio by buying all small stocks or all growth stocks, or some other misbalanced assortment of stocks.  Back in 2000, Some people bought all Internet stocks; they got burnt when they all crashed together.   You have to diversify across industries.  Unless you know what you are doing, it is best to buy mutual funds that will diversify for you.  Buy no-load, low cost funds.  Mutual funds should have expense ratios of less than 0.5%. <br>
 <br>
If your company offers a 401K plan at work, try to invest the most you can. The money grows tax free, and some companies will match your contribution. Investing in a mutual fund IRA is also a good idea. If you have children, you may want to consider a 529 plan or other college savings plan that grows tax free. <br>
 <br>
I like index funds. Because of their broad diversification, you are less likely to have a dramatic drop in value. They also have the lowest expenses. For stock funds, I would suggest putting ~70-80% of your money in the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund. and ~20-30% in a foreign stock index fund. The Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund is good for a bond fund.  The Vanguard Target Retirement funds can be good all-in-one stock and bond funds for an IRA.  However, there are many different opinions out there on what the best mutual funds are. Read the links below and form your own opinion. <br>
 <br>
Buying a house instead of renting will save you a lot of money in the long run. You don&#039;t have to pay rent and you build equity in your house instead. Buying rental property can be a good investment for some people.  However, being a landlord can be hard work, and many people are not good at it. If you don&#039;t know how to handle deadbeat renters, you can have trouble.  <br>
 <br>
If you have high-interest debt, like credit cards, it is best to pay this off first before trying most of the investment ideas above. You should also have 3-6 months of salary saved up as an emergency fund in a bank or money market fund before trying more risky investments.  <br>
 <br>
I will warn you that there is a tremendous amount of stock investing books and websites that teach stock investing strategies that don&#039;t work.  Particularly bad are people that teach &quot;technical analysis&quot; systems that sound impressive, but don&#039;t work. <br>
 <br>
Believing advice you get on Yahoo answers can be risky, so read these websites for further information. If you find it too confusing, contact a professional financial advisor. They will charge you significant commissions, however.
        </p> you should blow it all on booze and chicks...kidding...you should invest in something that would benefit your future, for example I have had an interest in film making since the age of 15, if I were as fortunate as you are, I would invest a camera so that I could start making films, right now I am in college studying production for film and television, and I would love to be able to purchase my own camera, but instead I have to borrow one from my school, which is difficult because my college doesnt have enough for everyone. So invest in something that you would like to do for a living.
        </p> I suggests SPY (Also know as Spiders) DIA (Also known as Diamonds) and of course GLD (Also know as Gold which is a good thing in times of war) A mutual fund focused in Oil is always a good choice in times of war. Sell GLD as soon as the President of the United States of America orders the troops out of Irak. But the way things are going he could actually order to invade Iran too (4th largest oil producer in the World)
        </p> You need to talk to a certified fee-based only financial advisor that can assess your financial situation and goals. They will map out a plan tailored for you.
        </p> I can&#039;t answer your question, but kudos to you.  I wish I was that smart when I was your age.
        </p> Joe&#039;s..Right..don&#039;t judge advice by how many thumbs down they have.
        </p> Water, agriculture.
