<h1>I have 5000$ that I would like to invest short-term?</h1>
<div class="answer">Hi. I would like to invest that money on a short-term basis ( maybe 2 - 3 months ) and get back some profit ( I don&amp;#39;t mind if it&amp;#39;s as low as 200 or 500$ ). Any ideas? companies? Thank you.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> If you want a safe return, try CD&#039;s or money market.  You could invest your money in a no-load mutual fund or stock, but there&#039;s no guarantee your money will grow.  You could buy some AAA insured bonds with short expiration periods... but be sure to buy them below par (under $1000 each).  Any brokerage company can help you with any of the ideas I&#039;ve recommended, as well as your local bank.  Good luck.

</script><p> I don&#039;t know about a 4% or 10% gain in just a couple of months. Naa I don&#039;t see it unless you want to be risky. Look for a volatile stock that fluctuates up and down like BXXX it was as low as $11.75 and got as high as 12.97 in the last 3 months. That&#039;s about a 10% change or $500. The trick is knowing when to buy and when to sell. <br>
 <br>
A little less risk but only about a 1% gain would be Bank of America (BAC) they will pay a dividend of .56 cents per share on Dec. 22 if you buy the shares before the 24th of November and hold them till after the first of December.  <br>
 <br>
So in one week you&#039;ll make...let see......@ $5000 that&#039;s about 90 shares and 50 bucks, plus or minus the stock price when you sell the shares and any commission from the broker. Hmmm... maybe not, unless you buy at 54 and sell at 57. I could happen ya never know.  <br>
 <br>
Or a CD at a bank buy you&#039;ll need an APY of between 16%-40% to get your $200-$500 by Feb. <br>
 <br>
Good luck
        </p> I would take a look at treasurydirect.gov. Treasurydirect allows you to purchase short term government backed securities (in this case t-bills that run 4 or 13 weeks) without commissions.  Current t-bill rates are hovering around 5% and are state and local tax free.  You would have to earn 7-8% in a taxable account (ING, money market accounts) for the same return.  This is just a broad overview.  If you would like a more specific answer or have any additional questions feel free to ask. Good luck!
        </p> A short term CD. Look at banks interest rates. You will be charge a penalty if you take it out to soon. But, you should make some money.
        </p> I am not an expert, but I would say depending upon how short term you are thinking, you should look into a short term CD or a money market account.
        </p> 4%($200) in 2 months is 24% annually so not low. Must go into market for that. IAU - gold etf - or EWA - Australia etf - two shots at it but must stick neck out if want that much.
        </p> It wouldn&#039;t matter if a person on here told you a great stock to invest in, because if you don&#039;t know the fundamentals of trading, you won&#039;t know when to sell or where to put stops etc. <br>
