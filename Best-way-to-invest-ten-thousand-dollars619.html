</script><p> I like the Royce Low-Priced Stock Fund Symbol RYLPX: <br>
 <br>
This is another great offering from Royce! This fund is run by Whitney George. This fund is up year to date ending September 30, 2009 44.65%! Over the last ten years this fund is up 12.02% per year while the Russell 2000 index is only up 4.88%.

</script><p> A mere $10,000?  That is barely an emergency fund, which belongs in CD&#039;s.  Is your job secure? Will your car last several more years without major repairs?  Most definitely you should have no credit card debit, ever, if you have money to pay off the high interest rates.  Any marriage plans?  If so, consider buying a house.  $10,000 down if done right can get you an &quot;immediate&quot; 80% return.  When your life is really on track you can look into your investing options.
        </p> Vanguard is a great option. If you really like the Vanguard philosophy towards investing, read the book the Bogleheads Guide to Investing. This should help answer your question.  <br>
 <br>
My advice. Don&#039;t just invest the money because you have $10,000 to invest. Before making any investment, define your goals. What is it that you want in 10 years? Is this money for retirement? If so, you should look into investing into a tax advantaged account like IRA with Vanguard.
        </p> It depends on what your comfortable level of risk is. You can invest in the stock market (with moderate or heavy risk) or you could take a safer route with a CD/mutual fund. I wouldn&#039;t go more then 5 years with a CD as it may not keep up with inflation
