<h1>I&#039;m 23, earn $50k/year, live with my parents and looking to invest about $2k/month?</h1>
<div class="answer">I want to take full advantage of not having to pay rent and car loans this year. I&amp;#39;m interested in short term (pull some out in a few years) and long term (10+ years) investments. Any advice?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Standard investment advice is that you should invest in a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and money market funds.  If you are like most people you will invest part of your money aggressively in stocks, and part conservatively in money market funds and bond funds.  Short term money should be in bonds and money markets.  Long term money is usually put partly in stocks and partly in bonds.  The links below have on-line questionnaires which will give you an idea of how to do &quot;Asset Allocation,&quot; determining how much to put in each type of investment. <br>
  <br>
You want to buy a diversified portfolio of stocks as individual stocks are too risky. Highly knowledgeable people can buy a properly balanced portfolio, but most folks have a difficult time balancing things on their own. They will misbalance their portfolio by buying all small stocks or all growth stocks, or some other misbalanced assortment of stocks.  Back in 2000, Some people bought all Internet stocks; they got burnt when they all crashed together.   You have to diversify across industries.  Unless you know what you are doing, it is best to buy mutual funds that will diversify for you.  Buy no-load, low cost funds.  Mutual funds should have expense ratios of less than 0.5%. <br>
 <br>
If your company offers a 401K plan at work, try to invest the most you can. The money grows tax free, and some companies will match your contribution. Investing in a mutual fund IRA is also a good idea. <br>
 <br>
I like index funds. Because of their broad diversification, you are less likely to have a dramatic drop in value. They also have the lowest expenses. For stock funds, I would suggest putting ~70-80% of your money in the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund. and ~20-30% in a foreign stock index fund. The Vanguard Total Bond Market Index Fund is good for a bond fund.  The Vanguard Target Retirement funds can be good all-in-one stock and bond funds for an IRA.  However, there are many different opinions out there on what the best mutual funds are. Read the links below and form your own opinion. <br>
 <br>
If you have high-interest debt, like credit cards, it is best to pay this off first before trying most of the investment ideas above. You should also have 3-6 months of salary saved up as an emergency fund in a bank or money market fund before trying more risky investments.  <br>
 <br>
I will warn you that there is a tremendous amount of stock investing books and websites that teach stock investing strategies that don&#039;t work.  Particularly bad are people that teach &quot;technical analysis&quot; systems that sound impressive, but don&#039;t work. <br>
 <br>
Believing advice you get on Yahoo answers can be risky, so read these websites for further information. If you find it too confusing, contact a professional financial advisor. They will charge you significant commissions, however.

</script><p> I don&#039;t think your a loser. Just live life at your own speed. Some people move out when they&#039;re 16 some stay till they&#039;re 30. I&#039;m 22 and I&#039;m just now moving out in a few days. And guess what, I&#039;m moving to a different city. A city where i dont know anyone! All alone man! Anyways, just be positive and don&#039;t listen to the haters. You gon be fine.
        </p> My only advice is don&#039;t ask random people on Yahoo Answers how to invest in a diversified portfolio for both short- and long-term gains. LOL...  <br>
 <br>
But since you asked, I have invested in real estate - with the low interest rates and declined property values in my area, I get great cash flow out of rental property, since rents are still high as ever. <br>
 <br>
I can rent a duplex I bought (paying $750/mo PI + $350/mo tax) for $1700/mo income. That&#039;s 40% return. By the time I depreciate it, consider equity gains, etc, I experience a very high return. When I want to sell, I can sell on contract very easily and finance the whole building to my buyer at 2% over prime amortized over 30 years for 5 years. It&#039;s a win/win.
        </p> How about a couple of books? <br>

        </p> Contact a brokerage like Schwab or Fidelity. <br>
Open 2 accounts. <br>
ROTH - up to 5k a year <br>
and a brokerage <br>
 <br>
In these accounts you can invest in anything you would like to. <br>
A roth can be used penalty free, before the 5 year period for the purchase of your first home. <br>
Don&#039;t just take the money out - tell the broker what you are doing - since you will have to fill out a special form for this. <br>
 <br>
Home prices could drop a bit unless the gvt steps in again. <br>

        </p> Now is not the greatest time to be investing, but these are some of the less risky choices.  None of the short term.  MCD, PG, CLX, CVX, KMB,  WMT,  ABT.  All but WMT pay at least a 3% dividend.  All are rock solid.  All have raised their dividends consistently for at least 25 years except for CVX.  Short term though you might want to put your money in the bank.  Things do not look too appetizing.
        </p> You&#039;re 23, earn $50k and want to live with your parents?
        </p> Why don&#039;t you just give the parents a break.  They&#039;ve had you for 23 years.  Give them some slack.  2K per month is more than enough for a place of your own.
        </p> invest at least 70% in equities - you&#039;re young, and can afford the risk
        </p> buy a nice house with a pool. Enjoy now.
