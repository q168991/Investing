<div class="answer">I have a couple of hundred to start playing with. I am mostly looking for sites that are legitimate and safe. And yeah, i am a newbie so good beginners tips and sites would be much appreciated. I want to know because i want to be doing this as i am older and i want to gain experience now. And i know some stuff but just about nothing, especially about investing, or investing terms.    Please no &amp;quot;Trolling&amp;quot; (A person who annoys others)<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Vanguard*** is a good site to learn about investing . Vanguard is a large fund family,has been around a long time and has a good tutorial on their site . They are a no load fund family . <br>
I started saving money and needed someplace to invest it so I went to a broker .  He sold me things that made money for him . Never buy anything with a sales commission like load funds and never buy annuities .

</script><p> I had a friend at 18 who started buying brand new top quality tools (we both love cars and bikes) and if he couldn&#039;t afford to buy something one week he saved till he could... every week buying or putting something aside. At the time I thought he was crazy spending good beer money on tools that were so nice he didn&#039;t want to use them. Now he has a collection of amazing tools and I have a massive beer belly. There is a moral to the story.... Maybe it is not so much what you invest in, as long as it doesn&#039;t loose value... the important thing is to save/invest regularly.
        </p> Difficult to give advice here because 200 is nowhere near enough. Let&#039;s say you had 2000. What could you do? You could build a diversified portfolio, say 6 or so stocks, but that would be 300 in each. Again too small really. Or you could bet the 2000 on one stock. Again a bit tricky. My advise is to save up a decent pot, say 5000, and in the meantime learn as much as you can. <br>
You could use your 200 on a spread betting account, but you could lose more than your stake if you are not very careful. Study the risk, gearing disadvantages and advantages, and potential loss.
        </p> Hey man, I&#039;m in your position also trying to seek out some well informative answers as well, first step before considering any efforts of investments is to understand the system - meaning have a basic foundation of knowledge and understanding on the basic principles such as the types of stocks and how you plan to allocate your efforts of investment for instance - monitoring firm activities such as RIM, they plan to release their new model of black berry and this is a make it or break it situation - I would analyze this scenario from many different angles and make a confident decision as to wether to invest or not, Last time I check their stock values have increased due to much publicity of the new model
        </p> Yeah I&#039;m kind of in your situation too and it started with my friend telling me her boyfriend has been fooling around making a few hundred on ***virtualbrokers*** . I found the site really confusing and I don&#039;t understand all the fees....but her boyfriend swears by this site and does research before he buys a stock. <br>
 <br>
I think this site also offers a free couple weeks of a sample software to get yourself warmed up (but don&#039;t quote me on this...I just think lol). <br>
 <br>
I didn&#039;t play around with this, but you might have some luck with it.
