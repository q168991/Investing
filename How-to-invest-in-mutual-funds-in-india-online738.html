<h1>How to invest in mutual funds in india online?</h1>
<div class="answer">i came across geojit paribas where you can invest in MFs online but they dont offer it to NRIs.
i informed myself online and could only find fundhouses offering their own MFs.
is there any AMC that offers online investment in MFs from different fund houses?

thank you in advance.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Investing in mutual funds in India is a great idea as it is comparatively less risky than investing in stocks. The only problem with mutual funds investment is the large variety of mutual funds schemes available in the Indian market, which makes it difficult to choose the one that most suits your needs. If that&#039;s the case, you can always consult firms like GEPL that offer financial advice. They have a dedicated team of experts in this field who will suggest the best mutual fund scheme according to your needs. They also have an online trading platform through which you can trade and monitor your investments.

</script><p> Investing in mutual funds is very low risk. But at the same time it can be very tricky. I would suggest you to take advise from a reputed stock broking house for your mutual funds portfolio. I handle my MF portfolio through Sushil finance and the results till now have been satisfactory.

        </p> Mutual fund is good option for investing money in India. <br>
 <br>
Mutual Funds is basically two types:- <br>
 <br>
- Close Ended <br>
 <br>
- Open Ended <br>
 <br>
In Close ended a time period is open for investing or switching money. <br>
 <br>
But in open ended no time required for investing or switching money. <br>
 <br>
You are invest in money in mutual fund in one short. And second way which is very good way for investing money in mutual fund. <br>
 <br>
Open A SIP(Systematic Investment Plan) it is a very good idea for investing money in mutual fund. <br>
In this you have invest monthly basis. you are started with your price....
        </p> First you research about mutual fund scheme and after invest in.
        </p> Go to company website and fill the form
        </p> Go to company site in which company you want to invest and fill online form and transfer your money.
        </p> If you&#039;re in America., and without doing any research, I&#039;d probably go with an ETF that focuses on India.
