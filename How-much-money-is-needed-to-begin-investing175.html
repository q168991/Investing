</script><p> No. To invest in stocks, I&#039;d say you should have at least $10,000. <br>
 <br>
An introductory book like _Stock Markets for Dummies_ is a good place to start.  This will give you a basic explanation of most things there are to know about the mechanics of stock investing including useful websites to surf. <br>
 <br>
Investors Business Daily (IBD) is a solid daily resource (and its complement, ***investors*** ). It&#039;s a better newspaper than the Wall Street Journal and it is built around a particular approach to trading. You could read _How to Make Money in Stocks_ by William O&#039;Neil too--he&#039;s the founder of IBD.  <br>
 <br>
Search your local library for other books on stock investing. Try to absorb as much knowledge and understanding as you can.   <br>
 <br>
After you have extensively researched and gained a solid foundation/education then look to open a brokerage account and paper trade--this is trading with play money before you put real capital at risk.  You should do extensively before you eventually place your first trade live.  Your early live trades should be with a very small position size.  Only increase position size when you have done well to limit losses when the market has turned against you.

</script><p> I would start out with an online brokerage firm that has low commission fees. Your going to be buying stocks that are riskier &amp; if you do make a profit you won&#039;t be able to quit your day job. All you need to do is make one mistake of buying to high &amp; you will either be forced to sell at a loss or you will be owning it for the next 5 years. I have seen stocks that are 1.50 a share lose 3% only to come back in a short period of time to gain it back. But if you see a stock drop like that, make sure you know the underlying factors. Are they being sued? Are they preparing to issue a new stock offering (which would dilute their shares)? Are they using their capital revenue to expand their business(such as opening new stores) which will cause investors to head for the hills until earnings per share rise again. Are they more of a research oriented co.that may take years to show a solid eps if ever. Most short sellers only hold a stock for around nine days.
        </p> With a jiffy horizon, shares are out of the question. you would be greater valuable off purely sticking that funds into financial employer CDs, in case you think of you are able to would desire to spend this funds. while you&#039;re genuinely particular you will no longer choose the money, the superb thank you to &quot;make investments&quot; is to start paying decrease back your guy or woman loan genuine now. Why could you make investments to repay a private loan? there is not any assure the inventory industry provides you with a favorable return. in spite of the undeniable fact that, once you repay your guy or woman loan you&#039;re assured a value of return equivalent on your guy or woman loan&#039;s pastime value.
        </p> The amount required depends on what you wish to invest in and how. You can begin with $1,500 but since its likely that you&#039;ll require a larger proportion of your equity to make your initial trades than a person with a larger deposit, be wary of the resulting exposure. I&#039;d begin with demo accounts first.
        </p> There is no minimum range limit for invest in stock market it&#039;s depends on which stock you want to buy.
        </p> just $1 lakh need for beginner who want to invest in stock market.
