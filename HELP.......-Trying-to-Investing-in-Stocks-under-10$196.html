<h1>HELP....... Trying to Investing in Stocks under 10$?</h1>
<div class="answer">I just started an Ameritrade account and I am looking for stocks that will produce high returns.. Right now I&amp;#39;m looking at PCS (Metro PCS) and INO(Inovio Biomedical Corp). Is this a smart move? If not what stocks do you think are good to invest in at this time?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> The reason for opening a brokerage account should rest on the investor&#039;s wish to make specific investments. If you&#039;re relying upon others to make your decisions, you will get exactly what you pay for such advice---nothing! People just love to make their recommendations known to others, especially if they think they can favorably impact on on the stock&#039;s popularity, causing the stock price to rise. Of course, this is usually a myth for few of us are able to influence the price per share when involved in a stock with a float of millions of shares. <br>
 <br>
Ameritrade handles my business also. I specialize in very highest risk small caps whose shares are as low as $0.0001. My largest position is BPT whose units sell for something in the upper $70 range. I do this for a living and am enjoying a 67% gain thus far this year. However, I never ask anybody to help me in the decision-making process. I help a circle of friends because I&#039;m a researcher but even they make their own investment decisions. <br>
 <br>
By the way, high returns are never a guaranteed fact because things happen, often without notice...terrible things, sometimes. The only way to remove doubt from a stock pick is to study the company. Go to the website, check on suppliers and outlets for their products and services. You can call the company and speak with someone in the Investor Relations department. That person will have intimate knowledge of corporate activity within and can help you gain important understandings. <br>
 <br>
I head up the Investor Relations Department of a small Texas energy company, myself. <br>
 <br>
Best of luck to you! And if I&#039;ve scared you a bit, that was my plan---all in an effort to prevent your becoming the next sucker to be born today, if you know what I mean. <br>

</script><p> I definitely believe these are some great stocks to invest in right now. Metro PCS is REALLY good in means of a long term investment. Back in the later part of 2007, even in the financial crisis, pcs was at nearly 40 points. But the economy has the stock on its knees at the moment to a current 6.5 points that it is now. So, in my opinion, if you hold on to the stock, by the time we come out of the financial crisis, the stock could be 10x more than it currently is at the moment. And I&#039;m not going to even get started with Inovio Biomedical Corp. It&#039;s stock has significantly jumped this year, and is bound to jump higher due to the swine flu vaccines.
        </p> The stocks you want to focus on is consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and healthcare. These are DEFENSIVE stocks that will survive through good and bad times. Most of my positions are in these stocks. Some names include 3M, Procter &amp; Gamble, Kimberly Clark, Exxon Mobil, Walmart, Costco. Everybody&#039;s got to eat and wipe their butts regardless of the state of economy. Many of these companies survived through the Great Depression. That&#039;s the benefits. You can sleep at night knowing your money is doing well. There are NO guarantees that you won&#039;t lose money. It&#039;s just that these stocks are the best. They pay good dividends too.
        </p> I agree with Mark. PCS is awful. Yes you could double your money with INO but there is a better chance this stock loses 90% unless you work for the company and know whats going on there. <br>
 <br>
check back in 3 months <br>
PCS 6.52 <br>
INO 1.53
        </p> Inovio Biomedical Corp noway! unless you have deep pockets to buy out the company! <br>
 <br>
Metro PCS is a good investment...but there are many more stocks to look at...for example: United Microelectronics Corp (ADR) (Public, NYSE:UMC), General Electric Company (Public, NYSE:GE), DryShips, Inc. (DRYS) etc etc...these stocks will fly up when the economy improves! <br>
 <br>
Good luck investing!

Don&#039;t limit yourself to stocks under $10. Just buy fewer shares of better higher priced stocks.
        </p> Few investment &quot;strategies&quot; are quite as obviously dumb as choosing a stock because of its price; if a stock cannot maintain a price higher than $10, then obviously (unless it just now split to improve liquidity), it is priced that way because it isn&#039;t worth much! <br>
 <br>
Who is the richer Anonymus? The one who has one share of BRK-B valued at $3,447? <br>
Or the one who has 3,830,000 shares of Invicta (0.0009 each) valued at $3,447? <br>
 <br>
Think about that. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Both MetroPCS and Inovio are FAR more likely to go to zero than they are to become winners.... <br>
 <br>
 <br>
MetroPCS has less than HALF the anticipated price-to-earnings growth of its peers; <br>

 <br>
And Inovio has less income and far poorer margin that its competitors; <br>
