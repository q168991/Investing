</script><p> There is no such best method to invest in mutual funds. The bottom line is to do some background check on the mutual funds company before you invest in them. Look at their past history record whether they are making money for their investor or not. If yes, how much?  <br>
 <br>
For online investment, you have to be little bit careful as most of the sites are fraud especially those promise for high return (e.g. 20-30% per month) <br>
 <br>
For mutual funds or unit trusts as in general, you can refer to <br>

</script><p> Most mutual fund companies will have an option to open an account online. You will have to enter in some information about your bank account so that you can have the money transfered over to purchase the fund with.   There are other ways. You can always open up a brokerage account like with E-trade or TD Ameritrade, or Scott trade.  You can purchase mutual funds through them and also stocks and other investments. However when you go through a brokerage account there are additional fees that you would have to pay. IF you are planning on being an active trade the brokerage account is the way to go.  <br>
If you are just going to buy a mutual fund or two and let them grow for a few years.. go direct to the fund. It&#039;s more cost efficient. <br>
 <br>
I personally use Vanguard funds because they have very low management fees and good performance.
        </p> For your question &quot; how can i invest in mutual fund online&quot; answer is that you have to register and become member of various online trading agencies like icicidirect***, sharekhan or geojit etc. You can click on mutual fund section in those, in simple steps they will direct for investing in mutual fund online.  <br>
 <br>
For the second question what is the best method online investing or offline, I am of the opinion that online investing is the best method, since the online platform maintains your portfolio and informs you of the total of your equity and other holdings position , how much unrealised gain or loss you have in your portfolio, risk profile etc free of charges. It also gives you comparitive analysis of the various mutual funds and helps you in deciding the fund.Further there is no n eed of going all the way to registrars or banks for investments.At the ease of your home you can make investments or redemptions. For offline investments, redemptions you have to spend your valuable office time, since these offices too function in office hours. In online investing , you can invest or submit request for redemption even at midnight, without leaving your home.Hence , online investing is user friendly, easy, informative
        </p> well both are same, you invest same money, you get same return. <br>
 <br>
investing olnine has convinience but need you to be comfortable doing so.  <br>
 <br>
offline you have papers, you may be mentally more comfortable with that. <br>
 <br>
it depends on how tech sevvy you are and at what frequency you want to invest. if you investing in mutual fund once or twice a year you may forget yuour password by the time you want to invest for the 2nd time.
        </p> Sharekhan and Reliance Money have started online mutual fund investing and redeeming services. You can register with anyone of them and start investing. <br>
 <br>
i think online investing is better... you can move money from your bank a/c to the mutual fund a/c anytime you want. you save the hassle of filling up the forms and submitting to the agent or amc. you dont need to save your a/c statements, folio numbers, investment certificates, etc. and the best part is, you can redeem wenever you want to, again saving all the hassle of form filing, etc.
        </p> If you have a good amount of money I would always go directly to the mutual fund company.  They don&#039;t charge sales fees when you buy direct.  search out all the major players and pick one.
        </p> Schwab*** has thier own + access to hundreds of other companies&#039; funds. Great resource + can buy stocks &amp; other investments in same account.
        </p> i hv ac in hsbc n thy provide the investment facility in mf and in equity yes thy do charge us but it is nominal n thy hv only reputed company mf only  n thy give advise on email also once u hv done trading though thm next time u hv to instruct thm on mail or application n thy do the rest ur money is deducted n u get the statement in 2 days that u hv got this mf so my experience says hsbc is best n i m sure other good banks also must be having same facility al the best
