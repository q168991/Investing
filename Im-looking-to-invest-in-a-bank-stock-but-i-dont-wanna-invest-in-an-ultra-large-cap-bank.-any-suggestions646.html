</script><p> Check out Arrow Financial (AROW).  They are conservative in their lending and making money.  Per msn*** Arrow Financial Corporation (Arrow), is a bank holding company that owns (directly or indirectly) two nationally chartered banks in New York (Glens Falls National and Saratoga National), an insurance agency (Capital Financial Group, Inc.), a registered investment adviser that advises the Company�s mutual funds (North Country Investment Advisers, Inc.), a Real Estate Investment Trust (Arrow Properties, Inc.) and four other non-bank subsidiaries whose operations are insignificant. Arrow�s business consists primarily of the ownership, supervision and control of the Company�s two banks. The Company also provides various advisory and administrative services and coordinates the general policies and operation of the banks.

</script><p> Check out US Treasury Bills. $1000.00 each. Maturity as little as 3 months. Yields lower than CD&#039;s but the income is federally tax exempt. Guaranteed by the US Government. Technically, more secure than CD&#039;s, prob not tooo much of a worry. CD&#039;s you pay state and federal income tax on the interest. Depending on your tax bracket will determine if CD&#039;s or US T-Bills are better for you. With a time frame of less than a year NEVER put money you&#039;re going to need soon in the stock market. Market time horizon should be 7-10 years. And when you have extra money to sock away. Put it in a Roth IRA. No tax deduct, but grows tax free after holding for 5 years, and can pull it out to buy your first home. See a tax advisor. -- See my bio.
        </p> I think Bank Of America is a really good option right now for you. <br>
I got it 2 days back and making profit  right away. See bank stocks won&#039;t give you immediate profits but if you are planning for a long term(1yr +) than you can double or 3X your money in that. Bank Of America is currently the best investment for anyone who is looking for good scripts.
        </p> Well, I have to second your notion of avoiding large cap banks.  <br>
 <br>
As for Arrow, judging by their records , they run themselves like a bank,  not a taxpayer-financed casino. Their net income has grown annually at a steady pace, and they didn&#039;t have huge swings , quarter-to-quarter. <br>

Remarkably, their loans past due percentage has barely budged from Dec 2006 to March 2009 (look at the Bank Holding Company Performance Report - a lot of it will be hard to understand, but you should be  able to pick up usefull info, nonetheless).  <br>

Also, their president holds about 1% of the open shares. <br>
