</script><p> This is how all those old people lose their life saving. They ask which stock is the safest stock, the broker gave them the one the he will make the most commission on. At the end the old couple lose everything <br>
 <br>
truth is, there are no single best stock. If you buy stock base on someone else&#039;s advice is it just gambling <br>
 <br>
I suggest you pick up a few dummy book about stock market and start there. Play with virtual stock before you put in real money

</script><p> OK, a few possible approaches to stock market investing, here we go.  The most popular (of the easy approaches) are buy-and-hold and dollar-cost-averaging. Buy-and-hold is only well suited to long bull markets, where the average returns will always take you higher over the long term.  Arguably, we haven&#039;t seen a steady bull market for several years now. However, it&#039;s always possible you might identify a winning stock, even in down markets. <br>
* <br>
Next, dollar cost averaging. To dollar-cost-average, you simply buy regular dollar amounts of stock at regular intervals.  This causes you to buy more when prices are down, and less when prices are up. Dollar cost averaging is actually a very mild form of market timing.  More elaborate forms of market timing, based on doing technical analysis of stocks, are generally risky and more difficult to perform.   <br>
* <br>
Sector investing is another relatively easy approach.  Here you trade money in funds between different sectors of the economy - i.e. defense, housing, banking, technology, gold etc.  This strategy requires a good working knowledge of the economy.   <br>
* <br>
Next are professional market timing systems.  These are increasingly popular computerized services that provide buy and sell signals to investors, managed either though a broker, or with a direct subscription.  Some are expensive (designed for day traders), while others are mild - providing only a trade or two per year for managing mutual funds or trading inside retirement accounts.  Basically, an email tells you to buy or sell. <br>
* <br>
This just scratches the surface, there are many other types and methods of choosing investments. Links with examples of the strategies discussed are listed below.
        </p> The answer, I think, should be based on your age and stock market education.
