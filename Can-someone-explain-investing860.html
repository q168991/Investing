</script><p> Investing is commiting money towards an ownership stake in a company, real estate or other commodity in the hopes for a future financial gain.  It&#039;s different from savings because you are taking a risk with your principal.  Savings is storing your money safely in a bank account or a money market account for short term needs.  A site you might want to check into is ***minyanville***  It is a site that teaches you about investing yet manages to keep it fun so you learn and don&#039;t get bored.  Hope it helps.  Have fun!

</script><p> Investing has its ups and downs just as real money flucuates in the real market...when is a dollar really worth a dollar? <br>
  how much of a gain or loss is exceptable? <br>
Take investors in Ford Motor Company Stock back before 1999..when the stock was priced at 50 + dollars a share.... <br>
now at the year 2007...the share is worth just under 9 dollars and hasn&#039;t paid a dividend since...some people believe that you don&#039;t lose money until you cash in the stock...what happens if it goes back up to 50+ ....you would not have made a profit but you haven&#039;t lost money either...and you have been sitting on that stock for 8 years now.... <br>
So invest wisely or you could lose all you have or be stuck with a share that goes nowhere fast.
        </p> Your basically loaning someone your money, which they then use to buy equipment, etc and make money, they then give you your money back with some profit (or they can lose it for you too) <br>
 <br>
I invest in China and other Asian countries as being the best bet for  the future
        </p> a bank pays you 5% interest, for example. <br>
 <br>
you invest $100 in that bank.  after a year, they pay you 5% of that (which is $5) so now you have $105. <br>
 <br>
you keep that $105 in the bank for another year.  5% of $105 is $5.25.  so your total after two years is $110.25. <br>
 <br>
so by investing $100 in a bank that pays 5% interest, after two years you will have made $10.25. <br>
 <br>
the bank makes money because they let someone else borrow your money at a % higher than 5%.
