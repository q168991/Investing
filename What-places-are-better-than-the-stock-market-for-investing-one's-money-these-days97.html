<h1>What places are better than the stock market for investing one&#039;s money these days?</h1>
<div class="answer">I&amp;#39;ve recently learned that someone very close to me has far too much of their funds invested in the stock market (say, 95% of their funds). I know that this isn&amp;#39;t a good idea, but I can&amp;#39;t think of a better idea these days for a place to invest them (he said bonds are not doing well these days either.

Does anyone have an idea for better places to invest their money these days besides the stock market? Perhaps at least whilst shooting for 4-6 year growth?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> To optimize investing, you proportion between risks with the most important division being at risk and not at risk.   For example if you have a $1,000 portfolio and set a target of 50% to be at risk invested in the stock market, and the rest cash (not at risk), then you would be starting with $500 stock, $500 cash.   If the stock were to drop in half you would have $250 stock, $500 cash and would buy $125 stock to rebalance back to your 50/50 position at $375 stock and $375 cash, if the stock were then to return to their original price as would often happen, you would have $750 stock and $375 cash for a portfolio value of $1,125 all while the stock has essentially been unchanged.   If the stock had doubled and then halved, you would&#039;ve gone from $500/$500 to $1,000/$500, rebalanced to $750/$750 and then dropped to $375/$750 again for a portfolio value of $1,125.   The funds that you hold in reserve in risk free investments represent an investment in opportunities.    <br>
 <br>
This is the essence of Ben Graham&#039;s book &quot;The Intelligent Investor&quot; often touted as the definitive book on investing by Warren Buffet except Graham recommends keeping about 45% invested in stocks and the rest invested in bonds.   It&#039;s also the subject of the book &quot;Fortune&#039;s Formula&quot; by William Poundstone though from a very different perspective.   You&#039;ll also hear Warren Buffet allude to this concept in his speeches, most notably his references to playing Russian Roulette with a thousand chamber or million chamber gun when commenting on the LTCM debacle (information theory and the geometric mean of outcomes are ruin averse algorithms in that the logarithm of zero is negative infinity, the Russian roulette analogy advocates being ruin averse) <br>
 <br>
Bonds are a contractual obligated return, they do lose in market value when interest rates rises but only in that they have to be sold at a discount in order to compete with newer higher interest bonds, no actual value is lost if the bonds are held to maturity so though it&#039;s true bonds won&#039;t likely do well, you will only lose value by trying to liquidate the bonds.   For a small investor, it may be just fine to use the money market as your risk free component though that will return about the same as a typical savings account but by using the money market (essentially cash) as the ballast to your investment, you are halving your commission costs of rebalancing (which you should only do perhaps once a year due to the overhead).  <br>
 <br>
A 50/50 portfolio may sound conservative but mathematically if you apply Shannon&#039;s Information theory which is the basis of all digital electronics and telecommunications or even Bernoulli&#039;s geometric mean of outcomes (which is really the same concept) then the optimal portfolio growth is achieved with a 50/50 portfolio and the more aggressive 95% and 100% portfolios are almost certainly guaranteed to lose money in the long run due to over betting.   Indeed the ultra conservative portfolios of 15% to 30% invested in stocks are the surest to profit and historically beat the aggressive funds once you take out the survivors bias in the claims made.   Using a few basic assumptions about the market that economists would use results in the optimum being 43% and possibly ranging from 10% to 85% invested whereas Ben Graham advises no less than 25%  and no more than 80% invested.   Yet almost everyone would recommend the aggressive funds to the young when in fact they would be most at risk of a total loss due to assuming such risks. <br>
 <br>
The stock market isn&#039;t a single place to invest money, it represents thousands of opportunities to invest, however it&#039;s up to you to proportion your investment amongst the available risks and the adage of more risk, more reward doesn&#039;t really apply as there is a limit to reasonable risks (see the St. Petersburg Paradox).   Also there is always one very important investment that should always be part of your portfolio and that&#039;s what not to invest. <br>
 <br>
Because of the plurality of options available on the stock market, I think it&#039;s still the best place to invest your money but you need to know how to proportion your investments.

Just adding that burying money is a way to lose money,   Inflation erodes the buying power of money,   <br>
For example.  take $1.00  50 yrs ago you could buy things like movie tickets, and food and drink.  now the same ticket costs $16 dollars, your jar money loses buying power every year,
        </p> Wine.  <br>
I&#039;m not kidding, apparently it&#039;s a great way to invest! Buy it now and sell it when it&#039;s vintage!
        </p> um...stuffing your mattress, burying it in a jar in your back yard, anything that keeps the volatility from affecting what you have. These days anything you invest in will turn sour on you eventually.....
        </p> Commodities and metals.
