<h1>Young, how to start investing in stock - can i do as low as $50?</h1>
<div class="answer">I&amp;#39;m 20 and have been brainstorming ways to increase my inflow of money so that I can save up enough for a house down payment eventually. However, I&amp;#39;m a college student living at home so I don&amp;#39;t have a lot of money, a few thousand in savings so far.

It seems like so many adults have stocks but can I do it without having to learn everything about it? Am I able to take something like $50 or lower and invest it in an up-and-coming company which I have high hopes for?

How do you invest in stocks anyway? Do I go through the bank? Do I just tell them where I want to put money into or do I have to pay someone to do it for me?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> With only $50 your options are somewhat limited.  Do you think you might want to invest say $50 on a regular periodic basis like once a month?  If that is an option then there is a way for you to get started without knowing anything much about investing.  That is to invest it in a mutual fund.  Many mutual fund companies have a regular investment plan where you invest $50 a month.  T Rowe Price has such a plan.  They also have a lot of different mutual funds to choose from.  Their phone number is 1-800-207-9717.  Since you are young, you might like to begin with a somewhat aggressive mutual fund that might yield a larger return than one less aggressive.  Several worth considering are Latin America, New Asia, New Era, Mid Cap Growth are a few that have very good records.  <br>

Call them up and talk to them.

</script><p> $50 <br>
Even if you quadruple your money (which would be extremely rare), you will still only make $150 a year in profit. <br>
The discount brokerages that will allow you to open with nothing to open an account are the ones that have the most complaints. <br>
You will be hit hard with commissions. <br>
About $10 to buy a stock and $10 to sell. <br>
Never go through a bank for this.  <br>
They will have fees that will drain your blood right out of your body. <br>
Discount brokerages are the only way to go.  The best require minimum deposits. <br>
Note:  You could also lose the entire $50 if you buy a risky stock and the company goes under.
        </p> It would be a good plan to avoid annuities. They have a very bad reputation that is well deserved. I am retired and I did plan for my retirement by investing in stocks and bonds. If you have earned income a Roth IRA or a traditional IRA is the way to begin. You can put up to $5000 a year into one. A traditional IRA has the advantage that you do not pay taxes on the money you put in but you do have to pay taxes on everything that you take out. A Roth IRA requires that you pay taxes on what you put in but do not pay taxes on the amount taken out. Personally, I prefer the Roth IRA but from the analysis that I have done I can really not see any distinct advantage of one over the other under current tax law. Not all of your investments should be within an IRA. Some--at least 1/2--should be outside so you can have access to the money if the need arises. You do not have access to funds in an IRA without penalty until you are 59.5.
        </p> Im 20 as well so i know where youre coming from...Heres the basics, first you have to pick an online trading brokerage, i would recommend &quot;Scottrade,&quot; just google it and set up an account, its pretty easy, if you hav any questions just call them and they will walk you through it....After you have your account set up, you can easily just transfer your money from your bank to your trading account just by entering in the amount you want to transfer....In my opinion the lowest amount i would start off with would be $500...and i would buy stocks that cost anywhere from 1-5 dollars because in most cases you want to buy stocks in bulk, so if you bought 100 shares of a 5 dollar stock it would be $500+the trading fee, which is usually 9 dollars...When you sold the stock, you would be charged an additional $9 as the trading fee...so when buying a stock its going to cost you $18 just to buy and sell it...For example if you bought a stock at $5.00 a share and sold it at $5.00 a share, you would actually lose $18.00 to the trading fee.  Hope this helped! <br>

O and no you dont have to tell the bank where to put the money, you do all that yourself on your trading account
        </p> With a single deposit of $50?  Well, that really isn&#039;t much but if you can save $50 a month then that will build up to amounts that will be sufficient to invest and there are brokerages such as sharebuilder*** that charge low commissions to buys, high commissions to sell and allow for fractional shares o be purchased.   Most banks also offer direct investment accounts in which you can purchase stocks but banks usually charge much higher commissions than a discount broker.   Give up on the idea of finding a cheap penny stock in hopes that you&#039;ll make it big, at some point the potential large return does not justify the improbability (see St. Petersburg Paradox) and there are a lot more issues with trying to research, and trade smaller companies as well as potential for the stocks to be manipulated to your disadvantage.   The more you learn the better, if you want no to low effort, invest in a no load, low fee indexed fund it gives you the best return for your effort.
        </p> There are many people just like you that are, or were looking to invest and those that did bought Mutual Funds and/or Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs).  One purpose of mutual funds is to help investors like you, who are either just entering the investment world or who have no investing experience.  Once you feel you at least have an understanding of investments you should look into ETFs which are similar to mutual funds but are traded on the exchanges. <br>
 <br>
Mutual Fund companies as well as ETFs have an entire array of products many will fit your needs. Read about the various products and in doing so you will be getting investment ideas and at the same time educating yourself about investing. <br>
 <br>
You could also contact the funds companies for more information.  I have found that Vanguard (http://***vanguard***/) &amp; Fidelity Investments (https://***fidelity***/) <br>
can meet your needs for mutual funds.  The service and information they provide is all free and you will find it helpful.  <br>
 <br>
Regardless of what you decide, do not ever let anyone tell you not to invest, especially those that do not invest themselves. <br>
Good luck on your journey
        </p> You can not really invest in securities with only $50.00.  Before you invest in any security, the first investment you should make is in yourself, and the best investment you can make is by educating yourself. Start your education by learning why you should invest and the importance of being able to make your own decisions or how the pro’s make theirs. <br>

Get into the habit of making daily visits to some websites like MSN Money and Yahoo Finance. (http://moneycentral.msn***/home.asp , http://finance.yahoo***/  <br>
 <br>
Other website that can provide instructions and help with procedures and terminology are Investopedia - http://***investopedia***/ Stock Charts - http://stockcharts***/ http://***investorshub***/ http://***1source4stocks***/, http://***tradingstocksguide***/tradin… <br>
 <br>
Visit some of the more professional websites like Zacks- http://***zacks***/  <br>
Smart Money - http://***smartmoney***/ Schaeffer’s  http://***schaeffersresearch***/ Some of these web sites will have advertisers who are worth looking into also. And remember, if they offer free information, get it. <br>
 <br>
Attend all the free seminars you can, just be careful and don’t get pressured into anything you really don’t want or need. Most schools offer courses in finance and economics, but very few will have courses on the mechanics of the investment markets, if they do try taking the course. You may want to consider on-line courses, the New York Institute of Finance use to have such courses. Try to get some fee information from the stocks exchanges they all have (had) free booklets, SIAC and some of the regulators (FINRA SEC MSRB CBOE) may provide some free literature. <br>
 <br>
You at least have made the right decision to start investing, this is the first big step and it won’t be your last. Keep taking those steps forward and along the way never take the advice from people that are not in the market or try to tell you not to invest. <br>
 <br>
Good luck on your journey
        </p> No.  With brokerage fees, you will probably end up losing money.
        </p> Online brokerage that (probably) your bank will offer.
