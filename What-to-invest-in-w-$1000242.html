<h1>What to invest in w/ $1000?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am 13 and have around $1000. I was wondering what to invest in? I looked at stocks but the market is falling. I was thinking about short stocks but most brokerages require more than $1000 to start a short stock account. Mabye Gold or gold or gold coins but I don't know where to sell them. I have my money in a CD that's almost up but im not making any money their. So what should I invest in I don't have a steady inflow cause I'm Only 13 any suggestions?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Only a few good answers at 13. <br>
 <br>
Invest in yourself. Take some music lessons, or some karate lessons, or a class in the stock market. Dont pay for lessons you can get for free, but if you are really interested in something beyond what you can learn at school or teh library or online, investing in yourself is the BEST thing you can do. And you can do it $25 and one book at a time. <br>
 <br>
Invest in a business. Buy TWO bicycles, one to ride and one to rent. Buy or start a newspaper route. Buy some car detailing equipment/supplies and some business cards and get your butt out there working afternoons and weekends. Buy a lawnmower and leaf blower. These kind of investments should pay off if you invest time as well as invest money.  <br>
 <br>
Invest in another CD. Get the best rate you can, but maybe the answer is to keep adding to your CD until you have more money to invest in something else. Learn about compounding of interest. at 3%, it takes 24 years for your money to double. But if CD rates go to 5% by next year, it will only take 14 years, and at 8% will only take nine years. Patience is a big part of learning to invest, and your comment &quot;not making any money there&quot; tells me that learning patience would be a good thing for you. Maybe the BEST thing.

</script><p> Because you are 13 and cannot open a broker account, I would stay away from stocks.  Shop around your local banks and credit unions and see if anybody has a better rate on a $1000 CD than your bank. <br>

If you don&#039;t need the money for several years, gold may be very profitable, the price is quite low right now, and will probably increase due to inflation.  Go you your local coin shop and see if they sell Krugerrands, American Eagles or Maple Leaf&#039;s.    Gold is $734 an ounce right now, but coins are hard to obtain, so they sell at a premium.  If you are lucky, they will have one you can afford. <br>
 <br>
Anyway, if you manage to buy gold, sock it away somewhere, watch gold prices and wait.  When you need money, or when gold hits $3000 an ounce, go back to the coin shop and sell them your coin. <br>
 <br>
Good Luck, young man. <br>

        </p> You could buy 1 gold coin. You pay about 50 dollars more than you would get if you sold a coin. Gold prices are extremely volatile right now so I would stand clear if I were you.  <br>
 <br>
You could get an ING savings account. Here in Canada they pay 3%. It is possible to set up a tax free account to take advantage of a new tax break. So 3% is pretty good.
        </p> You might need to be 18 to buy stocks because you need an account in your own name unless your parents will set it up for you.  Right now AIG is hot.  It just can&#039;t get much lower than what it already is at.  People who trade AIG say the lowest they expect it to go is $2/share.  Right now it got down to $1.70/share.  You could be looking at more than double in the next 2 months.  Of course the company could go out of business too, but even then you don&#039;t lose all of it.  You take a loss, but you can still sell out of it if you need to.  Best thing to do though if you want to play it rather safe is to only put in $500 and if it goes down some, put in the other $500.  Your average price will be lower.  Of course if it goes up, that&#039;s the risk you take.
        </p> You are too young to get a brokerage account.  I don&#039;t sell short, but I sometimes by ETFs that are the equivalent of a short sale  but your loss cannot run as high as it could if you short a stock at $ 1 and it rises up to $ 100.
        </p> I purchased thousands and thousands of barrels of oil after they price $60--$one hundred a barrel. I count on to make a kill whilst I promote. But correct now it’s most effective over $a hundred and forty a barrel. So this is my crisis: I have asked my sellers spin the media, like: “Oil long term appears prime, anticipating to be within the variety of $two hundred a barrel quickly” But it does now not paintings rate up speedy adequate. I have paid the mainstream media, the Think Tanks, and the fundamental PR speaking heads, to spin China and India (give and insist) liable for rate hike, to deflect American public anger. But that doesn&#039;t cross some distance adequate. Right now, I am enormously apprehensive and concerned. I urgently desire a prey to shop for the ones “paper barrels” on my hording. So I can benefit. But in which can I uncover my prey ?
        </p> Get a high interest, fixed term deposit account where it has to stay for say a year then after a year review your options again when the markets are less volatile.
