</script><p> Dear Sir, <br>
              You have not mention your age which is important in making any suggestion on Investment <br>
  I assume you are 35-40yrs.And have medium risk taking abilities; <br>
              1) 50% of Rs.15000.00 i.e buy KVP or NSC from post office.Please note that returns from  <br>
  KVP are fully taxables whereas that is from NSC have some tax reliefs.But both investments are <br>
  100% safe secured and have assured returns. <br>
              2)With the 30% of the money buy some shares of a good company when the market is  <br>
  down.But before investing in sharemarket you should accquire some knowledge or you should  <br>
  take help of a Expert.Study the market for 3-4 months and follow the rates of some leading stocks <br>
  (i.e. shares) and you will realise when to buy. <br>
              3) Rest 20% invest in some units of good Tax Saving Mutual Funds. <br>
                   Wish you good luck.      NANDADULAL DAS
        </p> Visit ***valueresearchonline*** to understand mutual funds. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
You can invest in the following 5 funds Rs 3000 each  <br>
 <br>
1) HDFC  EQUITY FUND <br>
 <br>
2) DSPBR TOP 100  <br>
 <br>
3) HDFC PRUDENCE FUND <br>
 <br>
4) RELIANCE GROWTH FUND <br>
 <br>
5) IDFC premier equity plan A <br>
Invest via SIP for 1 year. <br>
 <br>
Review the performance &amp; rating before renewing for another year.
        </p> Best investment plan is Invest in land/property. But that cannot be done by SIP but buying good property in loan also is one of the better option. Consult others about risk factor before investing in anything as in land there are lot of fraud happening.
        </p> It takes a long time to learn the stock market and for someone that wants to start investing in the market needs to decide what risk level he wants to take.  CDs backed up by the government has about 3-4% annual return for the long term with a low risk.  Bonds or Bonds Funds has about 5-7% annual return for the long term with a medium risk.  Stocks or Stock Mutual Funds has about 8-10% annual return for the long term with a high risk and are more volatile than Bonds. Usually the more risk you take, the more return you will have, but not always.  To see the Return vs Risk go to: http://oi51.tinypic***/2l8atxh.jpg  If you can&#039;t see the Return vs Risk table, let me know and I will send it another way. The stock market is basally made up of stocks and bonds.  Investment managers pick a group of stocks to make a mutual fund or a group of bonds to make a bond fund.  They even put a mixture of stocks and bonds together and call it Growth &amp; Income Fund.   <br>
  <br>
1- Mutual Funds: I like mutual funds because they have a group of stocks, could be around 100+, invested in different sectors, and manage by a professional. Managers have lots of schooling for investing in stocks, around 8 years (I just barely finish high school and I type with one finger). So I think managers can pick stocks better than me. But what I don&#039;t like is the fact that most funds has trading restricting and you may not be able to trade more than 4 times a year. That&#039;s because it makes it hard for the fund to make a good return if there is to much trading in the fund, causing the fund manager to make more buys and sells. Mutual funds are meant for long term investors. <br>
2- Stocks: Stocks is more volatile than funds unless you spread you money in about ten different sectors and know witch sector will do best. And stock trading restricting is only a few days and that&#039;s something that I like. If you own stocks, you need to keep up with all the company&#039;s business so you don&#039;t get stuck with a bad stock.  <br>
3- ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds): ETFs are like a mutual fund but trades like a stock and that is my main reason why I like ETFs. There are some ETFs that represents Index&#039;s. An Index is like S&amp;P or DOW. Index&#039;s operate just like a mutual fund with a group of stocks in deferent sectors, manage by professionals.  You can&#039;t buy Index&#039;s because they are not for sell.  A company owns them.  But you can buy a mutual funds or an ETF that has the same stocks as the Index they represent.  There are a lots of different kinds of ETFs for someone to choose from. Some have 1x leverage, some have 2x leverage, and some has 3x leverage.  There are some that represent almost every kind of sector.    <br>
 <br>
You can find several good brokers that charge $8.00 and under, per stock trade and no fee on Noload Funds. Most broker websites have good research tools. Some popular broker websites are Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, E-trade, Scottrade and others.  I think you need a min. of $500 (some sites $2,000) to open a broker account.  <br>
