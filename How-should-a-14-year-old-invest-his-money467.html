<h1>How should a 14 year old invest his money?</h1>
<div class="answer">hi im 14 and ever since i was a little kid i would always save my money and never spend it. i have a little over $1000 and its just sitting in my shoe box at home. i was wondering how i can make more money off of interest or putting it in the bank or something like that. i just want to have a good amount of money saved up for when im older. also, my parents already agreed to opening my own account if we find one that is right for me. so basically what im saying is how can i make/invest more money with around $1.2k?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> I was once in your shoes and I thought it was enough to just put it in a bank account and get a few quarters in interest every month. You have to understand the concept of risk/reward. Stocks might pay you 5% or more, but that&#039;s because there is risk involved in holding stocks. There are two kids of stocks to consider- growth and conservative stocks. Growth is more speculative, usually. Think of a company like Apple. You might buy into it, and in 5 years Apple might go out of fashion. However, a more conservative bet would be like Walmart or Chevron... a company that is already well established and is reliable to deliver steady, somewhat boring returns. The good things about most of the conservative stocks is that they pay a dividend. So, for each share you hold, you will get 50 cents or something, which you can have automatically reinvested for free to buy more shares. Those more shares, then get a dividend, which buy more shares and it goes on and on until one day you&#039;re rich.  <br>
 <br>
in your case, I would recommend researching direct investment plans. Some require $500 minimum to start up. And you do not want any that charge you for additional share purchases or dividend reinvestment fees. Some that I can recommend are Kelloggs cereal, which you can start into for as little as $100 I think. General Mills and Conocophillips are two other good ones. <br>
 <br>
Go to each of those company&#039;s investor relation websites for more info. But you could set up a Kellogg account for $100 and have one share of the company in about a week. That will at least get your feet wet. <br>
 <br>
Then you should read some books about stocks. Read books about Warren Buffet. Basically, you need to find good companies and buy them at the right price. Good luck.

</script><p> If you can risk losing it (at 14 you can most likely) Get one of your parents to set up a custodial account for online trading of stocks. Most let you start with $500. Then spend a good bit of time looking for a few stocks of companies that are fairly strong but have a stock price that has gone down mostly due to everything being down in price. When you find a couple you like that you feel have a strong business but the price doesn&#039;t reflect that (it&#039;s lower than it should be) then buy those. If you put in the time and effort to research the companies you invest in, and don&#039;t get emotional with your trading, you can make quite a bit of money, especially with the stock market being down right now. The key is putting in the research time and paying attention to your investment. Again, only do this if you can risk losing the money.
        </p> Penny stocks are loosely categorized companies with share prices of below $5 and with market caps of under $200 million. They are sometimes referred to as &quot;the slot machines of the equity market&quot; because of the money involved. There may be a good place for penny stocks in the portfolio of an experienced, advanced investor, however, if you follow this guide you will learn the most efficient strategies https://tr.im/e3f14
        </p> Penny stocks are prone to violent fluctuation (volatility), many people believe that they&#039;ll luck out with a stock that will jump from $0.08 to $8 in two weeks. And it&#039;s happened. Learn here https://tr.im/J4D8x  <br>
 <br>
Scour enough investing message boards and you&#039;re sure to find success stories from investors who made a mint while &quot;playing the pennies.&quot; <br>
 <br>
Companies that can successfully make the jump from penny stock to power stock are rare, but when you find them they pay out in spades. Numbers vary quite a bit in the penny stock world, but investors have raked in gains over 1,000% in a couple weeks&#039; time. The real trick is finding the right stock.
        </p> There are a lot of things to consider when trying to decide how to invest some money. I found a quiz once that has helped me in the past (see below). Basically it asks you a bunch of questions and your answers determine which category of investor you fit in. <br>
 <br>
There isn&#039;t any one right answer, but this might give you a compass heading / direction to explore further. It certainly helped me.
        </p> I wish I had that type of money while i was 14. You should get into stock. It multiplies your money if you know how to play the system. Study the system and have your parents help you. You may not see a big gain automatically but trust me it&#039;s worth it. Although there are some risks in stocks. Anyway, I hope you find financial gain with your money! ^_^
