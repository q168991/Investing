</script><p> Hi Hennjer, <br>
 <br>
Welcome aboard!!.....firstly, you&#039;ll need to decide what type of investment suits you, so perhaps you should invest in YOURSELF a bit to begin with.  I&#039;d highly recommend that you check out a few books and perhaps enrol into a course or two so that you can network with other people and learn from others mistakes and triumphs. <br>
 <br>
These two books in particular are absolutely awesome and a MUST READ for anyone investing (from the beginner all of the way through to the seasoned investor): <br>
 <br>
Robert Kiyosaki - Rich Dad, Poor Dad <br>
 <br>
George Samuel Clason - The Richest Man In Babylon <br>
 <br>
 <br>
If you wish to focus upon stock market investing, check out these books: <br>
 <br>
Stan Weinstein - Stan Weinstein&#039;s Secrets For Profiting in Bull and Bear Markets: <br>
- This book focuses upon looking at charts and how to interpret them and uses some excellent examples of how the &quot;30 week moving average&quot; concept applies. <br>
 <br>
Mark Douglas - Trading in the Zone: Master the Market with Confidence, Discipline and a Winning Attitude: <br>
- This book focuses upon psychology of trading and how our past experiences can have an influence on our future behaviour. I&#039;m not much of a fan of psychology stuff in general, but this was a fascinating read and an absolute must before placing ANY trade whatsoever. <br>
 <br>
Van Tharp - Trade Your Way to Financial Freedom: <br>
- Another terrific book that deals with quite a lot of information in an easy-to-read manner. This book is the absolute best when it comes to &quot;risk management&quot; using a technique known as &quot;position sizing&quot;. <br>
 <br>
I&#039;ve also recently seen the recommendations of &quot;The Intelligent Investor&quot; by Benjamin Graham and &quot;Security Analysis&quot; by B. Graham and D. Dodd. Yet to read them myself, but they look good. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Once you&#039;ve read those and you&#039;re clear about your goals and objectives (never forgetting to give back to society as a whole too!!), then you&#039;ll need to do some research into what strategies work best for you. Be sure to look into things such as share trading, contracts for difference (CFDs) and options. This may all sound scary and risky, but believe it or not, CFDs and options are actually designed to minimise your risk and are actually less risky than owning shares outright (and require less capital to begin). However, do be aware that CFDs cannot be traded in the United States - but options certainly can!! <br>
 <br>
Be sure to take a look around at various strategies and learn as much as you possibly can. You can look at &quot;stop losses&quot;, &quot;options&quot;, &quot;covered calls&quot;, &quot;collars&quot; and &quot;dollar cost averaging&quot; as a few strategies to help minimise risk. Most importantly, you need to find a strategy that fits your personality, risk level and dedication level. Listen to your inner voice and you&#039;ll certainly find your true calling. <br>
 <br>
All of the best in your journey, it&#039;s a great ride to be involved in. Number one rule though, be sure to be comfortable with whatever you choose to do - you only have yourself to answer to!! <br>
 <br>
Cheers!!
        </p> If you are willing to wait ten ore more years. the best thing overall would be the Standard and Poors 500. Adjusted to inflation it grows about 5% a year.
        </p> Dear reader, <br>
