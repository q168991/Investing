</script><p> Standard investment advice is that you should invest in a diversified mix of stocks, bonds, and money market funds. You want to buy a diversified portfolio of stocks as individual stocks are too risky. Most folks have a dificult time buying a properly balanced portfolio of stocks on their own. They will misbalance their portfolio by buying all small stocks or all growth stocks, or some other misbalanced assortment of stocks. Unless you know what you are doing, it is best to buy mutual funds. I like Vanguard***, other people like Fidelity, TIAA-CREF, and DFA. Buy no-load, low -expense funds. If you are like most people you will invest part of your money aggressively in stock funds, and part conservatively in money market funds and bond funds. Vanguard has an on-line questionnaire which will give you an idea of how to do &quot;Asset Allocation,&quot; determining how much to put in each type of fund. <br>
 <br>
If your company offers a 401K plan at work, try to invest the most you can. The money grows tax free, and some companies will match your contribution. Investing in a mutual fund IRA is also a good idea. If you have children, you may want to consider a 529 plan or other college savings plan that grows tax free.   <br>
 <br>
I like index funds. Because of their broad diversification, you are less likely to have a dramatic drop in value. They also have the lowest expenses. For stock funds, I would suggest putting ~70-80% of your money in the Vanguard Total Stock Market Index Fund. and ~20-30% in a foreign stock index fund. However, there are many different opinions out there on what the best mutual funds are. Read the links below and form your own opinion. <br>
 <br>
If you have high-interest debt, like credit cards, it is best to pay this off first before trying most of the investment ideas above. You should also have 3-6 months of salary saved up as an emergency fund in a bank or money market fund before trying more risky investments.  <br>
 <br>
Believing advice you get on Yahoo answers can be risky, so read these websites for further information. If you find it too confusing, contact a professional financial advisor. They will charge you significant commissions, however.  <br>

Asset Allocation Calculators <br>
(Determining how much to put in stocks and how much into bonds and money markets is a personal decision depending on your financial status. These Asset Allocation questionaires give you a rough idea how to do this. I like Vanguard best, but try some of the other sites as well.) <br>

</script><p> Your first option should be to fund fully a retirement account. If you do this, and you have extra cash, then one of the best things you can do is open a DRIP Plan. <br>
 <br>
Go to :  low-cost-stock-recommendations <br>
 <br>
*** <br>
 <br>
Click on the &quot;DRIP&#039;s&quot; Button on the Navigation Bar <br>
 <br>
These powerful investment plans are seldom talked about because brokers make very little money when they suggest them. Yet, they have proven to be one of the best, if not the best, long-term strategy on Wall Street.  <br>
 <br>
They are perfect for small investors, as well as big investors. They are safe and allow you to not care about whether the market is going up or down. They are a must for any serious investor. <br>
 <br>
If you decide you are interested in DRIP Plans, click on the advertisement on the same page &quot;$4 to purchase stocks&quot;. This will answer your next question, which is, How do I get started? and what is the least expensive way to get started? <br>
 <br>
I strongly recommend looking into it. They are great plans. <br>
 <br>
Good Luck
        </p> It largely depends on what you call a large sum of money, your age and your investment priorities. <br>
 <br>
The best person to advise you is a money manager.  However, finding a good one (who is also a member of an honest firm) is very difficult.  I would suggest asking people that you know (who are wealthy) who they use.  Don&#039;t be shy they&#039;ll be pleased to help you.  Find several and interview each.  Then make a decision. <br>
 <br>
You should note that the vast majority of wealthy people use a money manager.  That should tell you something.
        </p> You should contact any reputable bank... <br>
 <br>
They should introduce you to a financial adviser... <br>
 <br>
A good financial adviser will sit down with you and determine your financial needs and goals. He should conduct a risk profile analysis with you that will give you direction into the type of investments suitable for your time horizon and needs. <br>
 <br>
The financial adviser should suggest diversifying your money across the 4 asset classes namely: <br>
 <br>
Cash, Property, Bonds and Equities (stocks)  <br>
 <br>
You should also be involved in his investment choices ask questions and understand the rationale behind his recommendations. <br>
 <br>
Don&#039;t get caught up in trading especially forex, futures and etc these are high risk and you could loose all your money.  <br>
 <br>
Good Luck...
        </p> You want to speak with a financial advisor.  I&#039;m pretty sure that that is what they are called.  Be VERY careful who you choose.  Before you sit down to talk with anyone, ask them up front what their fee is and make sure that they have no other agenda.  A lot of these people want to manage your money for you. They also want to pocket a lot of your money.  Diversity is the key.  Just make sure you will pay a one time fee and that is it.  That person may charge anywhere between $500-$1000 and after you have the meeting, he/she will tell you how to invest your money. <br>
 <br>
Another thing you can do is watch Jim Cramer&#039;s &quot;Mad Money&quot; on CNBC, Mon-Fri. at 6 &amp;11pm.  You can learn a lot from Mr. Booyah!  Also, Suze Orman can give you some good tips.  I believe she is on between 9 &amp; 10pm on Saturdays, also on CNBC. Check your tv listings to be sure.  I hope this helped you. <br>
 <br>
Again,  I can&#039;t stress this enough.  BE VERY careful who you pick to help you.  Good Luck!!
        </p> The secret word of trading success is &quot;organized&quot;. You can&#039;t be successful without a strategy, a plan and some kind of technological support. I use a software called &quot;autobinary signals&quot; that is helping me a lot. There are plenty of them on the market. I recommend this one because it&#039;s very easy to use (you don&#039;t have to be an expert or have special skills to make money with it). <br>

        </p> Consider this option when planning to invest some money. It is no longer safe to just put your money in any business. If you planned to invest money for better ROI in the future there is one and only left reliable form of investment. Just check the link below..

i have attended a lot of seminars, read counless books on forex trading and it all cost me thousands of dollars. the worst thing was i blew up my first account. after that i opened another account and the same thing happened again. i started to wonder why i couldn,t make any money in forex trading. at first i thought i knew everything about trading. finally i found that the main problem i have was i did not have the right mental in trading. as we know that psychology has great impact on our trading result. apart from psychology issue, there is another problem that we have to address. they are money management, market analysis, and entry/exit rules. to me money management is important in trading. i opened another account and start to trade profitably after i learnt from my past mistake. i don&#039;t trade emotionally anymore.  <br>
if you are serious about trading you need to address your weakness and try to fix it. no forex guru can make you Professional trader unless you want to learn from your mistake.
