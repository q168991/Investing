</script><p> I´ve been investing for more than 20 years and trading for almost 14, and I can tell you that if you want to make BIG and FAST profits, I recommend you trading rather than investing, trading can help you to go from rags to rich. <br>
 <br>
If you are investing, you must have already achieved some degree of financial success, long term stock investing and/or FOREX can help you become much richer than you are today. <br>
 <br>
My experiences as a Nasdaq Market Maker, Head trader of brokerage firms, and currently as a professional trader <br>
and private hedge fund manager, I can suggest you that: <br>
 <br>
We trade because we want quick, short term profits on a consistent basis. We want to cash flow the market. Milk it like a cow. <br>
Make consistent, small, short term gains rather than trying to hit a home run on every trade. Don&#039;t ever forget that. <br>
Don&#039;t marry a stock, marry the idea of making money trading stocks. That&#039;s the only way to do it. <br>
 <br>
For me &quot;All stocks are equally worthless” <br>
 <br>
I don&#039;t hold on to any illusion that the stock market will continue to go up and provide a nice retirement for me. <br>
I could care less which way the market goes. It&#039;s irrelevant to me if the market goes higher, crashes or moves sideways for the next 50 years. I really could care less. Stocks are just four letters with two prices next to them that I use to make a living trading. <br>
 <br>
Trade ONLY when you have a clear, easy and identifiable advantage, because without a CLEAR EDGE your odds of success are NO better than a flip of a coin… That´s why so many new traders (and investors) lose money. <br>
 <br>
Take a look at any daily chart of any index or stock and you&#039;ll probably see the most volatility and the biggest opportunity for profit during the &quot;First Hour&quot; of the stock market&#039;s opening. <br>
 <br>
The popular thinking and conventional wisdom is that you should wait about an hour before you start trading. <br>
 <br>
But if you do, you&#039;ll miss the big, fast moves that stocks make as all the amateurs let their emotions out through their <br>
online accounts, usually right after they read some news headline or hear Maria Bartiromo go off about a stock on CNBC. <br>
 <br>
It&#039;s easy to see why trading the open is the market&#039;s prime time for profiting from other online traders. <br>
The market&#039;s open is very volatile - that is the perfect environment for LARGE, FAST profits. <br>
 <br>
Learn to trade as a professional Market Maker ,not as an emotionally driven amateur trader or investor with few thousand dollars in an account at Etrade. <br>
 <br>
There isn&#039;t any other time during the day or any stock you can invest in, that can make you 1, 2, 3, 5, 7 or more points <br>
in minutes OTHER than during the first hour the stock market is open. That&#039;s why I love trading the open so much. <br>
 <br>
I trade only when I have an edge and that means &quot;only the fisrt hour the market is open&quot;. <br>
 <br>
If you are a beginning trader, you can give yourself an unfair advantage in the market trading this way. <br>
 <br>
I can continue giving you a lot of advises about how to make money trading, but if you ask me: <br>
&quot;What is the best thing you can do for me or that I can do for myself? <br>
 <br>
Go to this &quot;Top Secret&quot; site and get the BEST stocks that will make the largest and fastest day trading profits you´ve ever seen... <br>
 <br>
***onehourtrading*** <br>
 <br>
After you review this site you won´t need a system, strategy, book, software or mentor to tell you what to do, <br>
you will be able to profit HUGE every day, picking your own stocks to trade. <br>
 <br>
Trade well, <br>
 <br>

</script><p> Investing in the stock market is not something to rush into. You need to spend some time learning about the different financial markets that are out there and the various products you can invest in. It&#039;s not just about stocks - there are commodities, bonds and currencies which you could invest in instead. You have to find the type of investment that interests you most and is best suited to your needs.  <br>
 <br>
One site that can help you learn the basics is http://***gnutrade***. The site has animated videos to teach you the basics and gives you a free unlimited play money account so you can practice trading on the real live markets without any risks. Also, the trading screen uses fun, game-like graphics which make it easier for you to see how the market prices are moving. <br>
 <br>
When you feel ready to trade for real you can use small amounts of money and even back other traders if you like their trading style.

        </p> I wouldn&#039;t jump right in to it.  Research the issues first and be certain that any money invested is money that you can afford to lose.  Remember, all investments in the market are not winners.  Some lose big time. <br>
 <br>
First hand, you should have 3-6 months of funds available in an accessible account for emergency funds.  Don&#039;t ever go without this if you&#039;re going to invest in the market as that rainy day could be just around the corner.  <br>
 <br>
Literature from brokerage houses or the NYSE could be a place to start learning.

 <br>
Tiny companies are a great way to make a fortune off of the stock market. Every trading day one thing’s almost certain: the biggest gaining stocks are bound to be penny stocks. The profit potential of penny stocks has been turning heads for some time now.
        </p> Hi Stacey, <br>
 <br>
I would recommend that you take at least one course in basic corporate finance or something equivalent before you start trading.  You should also read some books on stock valuation, and sensible investing. <br>
 <br>
Investing in the stock market is a science and before you invest you need to do a lot of analysis to make decisions.
        </p> Try this site out: http://***updown***/ <br>
 <br>
This place lets you jump into the stock market with virtual money so that you can practice. It gives you a million dollars starting out and is based on the actual stock market as of now. You can go ahead and invest as much as you want at no risk.
        </p> You should do about 4-6 months of research before you do anything.  You need to know the ins and outs of the market and any stock you are even thinking about investing in.  Jumping right in without knowing EXACTLY what you are doing is suicide!
        </p> You might consider investing in a tracker fund. These follow the market (typically the FTSE indexes) up and down and would give you a feel for how markets move. <br>
 <br>
I used to have individual shares but have moved out of them and into trackers. Much less onerous and it spreads the risk. <br>
 <br>
If you fancy a flutter, try spread betting. It&#039;s a quick way to lose money on the markets!
        </p> Before buying anything, I will advice you to educate yourself about the stock market. Get books at your local library or read articles online about how to invest in the stock market. You could also watch Jim Cramer on CNBC Mon - Fri at 6pm and 11pm EST.

         I started knowing nothing. It was pot luck for me, but fortunately I haven&#039;t lost my initial capital.  <br>
I read the financial pages and picked mostly blue chip stock.  (The top 100 quoted companies). <br>
Had the odd gamble like Signet which cost a few pence after Gerald Ratner rubbished the stock at a board meeting. <br>
It is a form of gambling.  Don&#039;t &#039;bet&#039; with more than you can afford to lose. <br>
Check out broker&#039;s charges, the one you choose will vet you.I just pay to buy and sell, no advice.  They charge for advice and if anyone really really knew they wouldn&#039;t be sitting at a desk, but off on a yacht somewhere. <br>
You get dividends usually twice yearly and there&#039;s the prospect of your stock&#039;s price rising.  Accept you are unlikely to buy at thr bottom and sell at the top.

i have attended a lot of seminars, read counless books on forex trading and it all cost me thousands of dollars. the worst thing was i blew up my first account. after that i opened another account and the same thing happened again. i started to wonder why i couldn,t make any money in forex trading. at first i thought i knew everything about trading. finally i found that the main problem i have was i did not have the right mental in trading. as we know that psychology has great impact on our trading result. apart from psychology issue, there is another problem that we have to address. they are money management, market analysis, and entry/exit rules. to me money management is important in trading. i opened another account and start to trade profitably after i learnt from my past mistake. i don&#039;t trade emotionally anymore.  <br>
if you are serious about trading you need to address your weakness and try to fix it. no forex guru can make you Professional trader unless you want to learn from your mistake.
