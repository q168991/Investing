<h1>Investing for a 15 year old?????</h1>
<div class="answer">Hello, I am 15 years old and just now getting a job for around $75 a week for my work permit from my school.  And, I want to start saving then investing my money in something big at a very young age so I don&amp;#39;t have to live my twenties as a broke college grad. trying to find a job as a Lawyer (which I plan on becoming one day).  Is there any chance of me basically starting my retirement plan right now?  I do not want to invest in mutual funds because I have already been doing that, and there is barely any progress, so what is there to put my money into as of right now? I just want to have an extraordinary rich life! lol thanks!<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> im around your age but i definitely don&#039;t think u need to start investing. if you have a job, save the money you&#039;re making. if you feel like you&#039;re going to spend a lot and have no control, set a budget per week or per month. or even give some of your money to your parents so they can watch over it. or put it into the bank! there are so many ways to keep. if you can save and budget well, the money you make will last you well into college. my older siblings had jobs throughout high school and quit when they entered college. even after going through college, they were never broke. they knew how to budget and spend on necessities NOT WANTS. you are wayy too young to think about retirement and what you&#039;re going to be when you&#039;re older.  <br>
sorry if i seem bossy or rambly here ;x
