</script><p> This is probably one of the most common questions I hear every day. People always ask me 1 of 2 things. How do I get started in investing? Or, how much should I start with?  <br>
 <br>
To get started in investing, the best advice I can give you is EDUCATE YOURSELF before you do anything. I&#039;m not saying you have to be a wiz to start, but don’t just jump in blind. That’s the express way to the poor house. So I suggest you learn the basics and don’t get ahead of yourself by letting greed go to your head.  <br>
There are various ways to educate yourself as well. Read books, attend seminars, pay for classes, and get a mentor! Just do whatever you need to do to learn more. Even though I’ve been doing this for more than 5 years, I still read every day and study new strategies, chart patterns and so on.  <br>
 <br>
Second, don’t get discouraged when you first start investing. I say this because you will make mistakes. Sometimes costly ones to. I made mine. You will make yours. It’s like driving a standard car for the first time. Everyone stalls out. Even if your confident and know what you’re doing by the book, you don’t have the &quot;feel&quot; for it yet and so you will stall. No and’s, if&#039;s, or buts’ about it.  <br>
Again, several ways to get around it, but it’s not going to be free. You have basically 2 choices, and I tell this to all the people whom I manage accounts for: you can either face it head on or take the knocks that are coming to you, or, you can pay someone like me to help guide you through the learning curve so the knocks won’t be so hard. Either way you look at it, you’re going to pay a price. In investing, there are 2 terms that investors use: &quot;the dumb money&quot; and &quot;the smart money&quot;. Dumb money is the crowd of investors who are new or don’t know what they are doing yet. The smart money is the investors that take the money away from the dumb money. Which one are you? Or where do you want your money to be?  <br>
 <br>
For the second question, how much you should start with. Well that depends heavily on your financial situation. Although the more the better. For anything less than a $3000 start up, I suggest IRA’s, CD’s, BONDS, or SAVING CASH. Why at least $3000 well its simple, without at least that much in your account, it will be difficult to make money in a down market. Yes, there are ways to make tons of cash when the market is crashing. In fact, it can easier and faster to do than making money in an up market. But I won’t get into that here. <br>
 <br>
Anyway, if you don’t have money and still would like to try, then I highly recommend paper trading. Why? Well its good practice for when you do get money. I used to paper trade  just for the practice. See how good my decision making skills are. Which brings us back to question one, and what you are doing right now, LEARNING! But remember, it’s not going to be free and it will cost you whether you pay for the education or you learn the hard way. Either way, just like Nike says, &quot;Just do it&quot; <br>
