</script><p> LIC market plus is a new MF scheme. LIC has a good reputation. But, i think you should try Birla Sunlife or HDFC equity funds or even SBI funds. These have performed better in recent times.

        </p> market plus of lic is ulip not mutual fund. although it is related market but it is still different from mutual fund.in mkt.plus your policy service charges and other charges will be more than of mutual fund.you can&#039;t withdraw your mkt.plus for atleast 3 year but if you go for open ended mutual fund you can withdraw your money any time. mutual funds are better than mkt.plus if you are seiking for investment.
        </p> if you are thinking of investing in mutual fund get few points clear. there is more than 25 mf companies and almost 1000 funds. and what you are asking for is just one of them. <br>
