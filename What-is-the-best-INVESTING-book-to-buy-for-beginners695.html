</script><p> I really like &quot;The Little Book that Beats the Market&quot;, by Joel Greenblatt.  It is a fun, short, informative read about value investing.  You might also want to take a look at http://***top10traders*** - this is a free site that lets you create a portfolio of stocks with $100,000 in &quot;play&quot; money.  Each day the site ranks the best performing portfolios, so you can see how your picks perform compared to other investors.  You can read posts on investing from the best traders, as well as share your own investing ideas.  There is a charting feature, so you can see how your portfolio performs compared to the S&amp;P 500.  Also, you can create your own &quot;group&quot; so that you can see how you are doing compared to your friends. <br>
 <br>
Here are this month&#039;s best traders: <br>

Good luck.
        </p> The best book will depend on your needs.  I could recommend to you: <br>
 <br>
 &quot;Learn to Earn : An Beginner&#039;s Guide to the Basics of Investing and Business &quot; by Peter Lynch et al   published in 1997 by John Wiley &amp; Sons Inc. <br>
  <br>
I think you&#039;d be better off finding books that are no older than 3 years and have the latest info. on investments.  Another great source is financial magazines and websites; they offer cool info. e.g bloomberg, fortune***, forbes***.  Those are some of my favs. <br>
 <br>
Perhaps, you might want to check out the personal finance section of your local bookstores: Barnes and Noble; BOrders or Books-A-Million.  They have cool books on personal finance and investing.
        </p> If you are a beginner to the world of investing, then I would suggest you visit the website, ***investopedia*** <br>
The website has tutorials and information regarding shares, stock markets, Mutual Funds.. <br>
As you get more comfortable, there is a lot of stuff for advanced users too.
        </p> &quot;The Successful Investor&quot;. DO NOT, I repeat, DO NOT invest until you&#039;ve read this book! It will easily teach you WHAT to do, and more importantly what NOT to do, and when to do it. You can get it from ***investors***. Also, it would be very advantageous for you to read the articles in their archives about how to properly read charts to find buy and sell points. Otherwise you&#039;ll just be throwing your money into the market HOPING not to lose it. Best of luck to you!
        </p> Investing for Dummies by Eric Tyson.
        </p> There are several books related to share market. Books like Dalal street etc very good to the beginners.
        </p> &quot;Come into My Trading Room&quot;, by Elder.  Intended for people who see themselves as full-time stock traders, it nevertheless has excellent advice for anyone interested in stocks at all.  Well written, an easy and entertaining read.  No punches pulled, no fortunes promised.
