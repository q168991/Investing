<h1>Best way to invest for a College student?</h1>
<div class="answer">Hello,

Thanks for helping out. I'm wondering what the best way for a 19 year old College student to invest $1000-$2000. With the stock market being as it is I'm looking into a lot for possibilities. Mainly Mutual funds but I'm not sure if thats the way to go. I've read about EMFs but I'm not sure what those are yet. I could also simply put it into a CD for a couple months for a decent return. Also I've looked at treasury bills but don't fully understand them either. Any help and/or explanation would be greatly appreciated.

Also any direction as to books to read about investing would help too.

Thank you very much. Your input is very much appreciated.

Sincerely,
          Marc<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Hi Marc, <br>
 <br>
Like Brad said, I think you meant ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds).  ETFs are similar to Mutual Funds, but have much lower &quot;Management&quot; fees (MERs) that you need to pay compared to those of Mutual Funds.  The average annual fee for ETFs lies around 0.50% to 0.75% while it is about 2% to 3% or more for Mutual Funds.  This makes a HUGE difference in the long term.  These are fees that you must pay when you own funds.  Moreover, ETFs are ***much*** safer than investing in individual stocks.  ETFs are &quot;basket of stocks&quot; in one stock.  So you have diversification - which is something extremely important when investing.   <br>
 <br>
A couple of places where you can &quot;shop around&quot; for some of the best (in my opinion) ETFs include: <br>
 <br>
- ***ishares*** (or ***ishares.ca if you are in Canada) <br>
- ***ssgafunds***/etf/index.jsp <br>
 <br>
A good pick for an initial buy could be: &quot;SPDR DJ Wilshire Total Market (TMW)&quot;, Link: http://finance.yahoo***/q?s=TMW  <br>
this is an ETF that contains many of the U.S.&#039;s top companies.  Even in the current market which is pretty rough, this ETF is pretty solid and not going down too much.  The companies in this ETF are the best in their fields (we called them &quot;Fortune 500&quot; companies) and they always perform well in the long run. <br>
 <br>
I invite you to take a look at the following resources to learn more about the basics of investing.  I wrote a book specifically for young investors and the first chapter is online for free.  I also have a whole chapter (5) that compares ETFs to Mutual Funds if you want more detail (note that you can also browse this chapter on &quot;Google Books&quot; link from my main page).  Please post any furhter questions about investing in this group and it will be my pleasure to help you out.  You really need to invest your $1000-$2000 wisely.  And your timing is actually quite great, as prices are really low now.  ETFs are really selling at good prices.   <br>

</script><p> Now is a good time to get into the stock market because prices are relatively low. Invest only what you can afford to potentially lose. Start small and learn as you go. I agree with pagodaboy - you should start a Roth IRA with any money you can spare. An IRA is a retirement savings account, where you invest normally and don&#039;t have to pay capital gains tax - but you can&#039;t have the interest earnings until you&#039;re 60. Choosing stocks is very difficult. You need to look at the company&#039;s history of dividend payments as well as judge how you think they&#039;ll do in the future. Unless you do a ton of research it becomes little more than a game of chance. You should probably start with a mutual fund with a long history of gains, or the simplest choice is an index fund.
        </p> Emf&#039;s? You mean etf&#039;s right? Etf&#039;s are safer than picking an individual stock generally. I would look into dia or spy for a long term hold till we get through this mess. Thing I like best about the dia, i can just look to the dow and tell how good or bad I&#039;m doing. Cd&#039;s a very safe bet. better than letting the cash sit in a low interest savings account. Rates are very, very low though now. Books and shows aren&#039;t going to help. it&#039;s just big mouth&#039;s spreading an agenda. that&#039;s a quick way to lose savings. pick a stock, do a lot of research, and decide if you trust your savings in that company to grow and retrun even more.
