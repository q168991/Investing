<h1>Where is a good non-stock place to invest my money?</h1>
<div class="answer">Okay, so I&amp;#39;m 17 and I have a few hundred dollars from my birthday and I was looking to invest the money in something that may one day bring me some sort of profit. I&amp;#39;m not looking to enter the stock market as the questions revealed, but I&amp;#39;m sure there are alternatives. I was told that buying coins and waiting for their value to go up, but how long would it take it to increase? Any suggestions or tips would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advanced!<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> I don&#039;t know why we have to listen to **** like revsuzanne&#039;s answer.  The problem with all that stuff is that the market prices it and the probability of any of it happening according to markets is 0.  That makes it just a fantasy.  So here it is:  If inflation is going to hit 25% next year, revsuzanne should be really happy to buy December 2012 18% inflation calls from me.  I will sell these calls on $1M notional for $10,000 each.  If inflation hits 25% in 2012, he will collect $70,000/call for a 1 year 600% return which is far better than he can possibly expect from silly silver coins.  What about it revsuzanne?  Let&#039;s do this deal... <br>
 <br>
The problem with all that drivel is that either a) it is not true or b) it is true and revsuzanne is the stupidest guy in the world for not having the faintest clue how to play it. <br>
 <br>
Edit: Do you think revsuzanne has any idea how I could sell those calls and take on little or no risk?  Of course he doesn&#039;t.  But let&#039;s get some money on this deal.  If you are a loud mouth with wild predictions you ought to be willing to bet on them.  If not, then your advicee in capital marketss isn&#039;t worth squat. <br>
 <br>
Edit 2:  I am also really happy to sell silver/gold ratio puts to revsuzanne.  If he is confident that the silver/gold ratio will go down to 16 then he ought to be really happy to buy silver/gold 24 puts.  I will offer up really good prices on those as well (and again I will hedge them at nearly no cost, since it&#039;s a wild fantasy).  Want to buy those revsuzanne?  Stupid kids...

</script><p> Buy gold coins. There value is going to go through the roof over the next few years, as the price of gold in general will. You havent seen anything yet. Trouble is just 1 small 22 crt coin (22 parts pure gold to 2 parts other metals) will be 400 dollars as the price has already gone up a long way. Maybe buy something with a lower crt value if you cant afford that like 9 crt gold jewellry. It&quot;s not as good.as.buying.coins though as you.are paying for the value of the shape and design of the jewellry and the work put.in to make It not just the price of the gold. Otherwise buy silver coins. You can get a large 1 ounce near pure silver coin for something like $35 atm. Silver is.expected to go up in price too, not sure if it will as much as gold though
        </p> By all means, hit your local coin/bullion store and get yourself either some 90% &quot;junk silver&quot; US coins or some generic silver bullion.  Stay away from graded numismatics... not a good value. <br>
 <br>
The silver price is currently being suppressed by the paper markets (the bullion banks), but it won&#039;t be long before the natural price discover of the market takes over. They&#039;ve managed to suppress the price of silver to 43-to-1 with gold, in spite of the fact that silver is coming out of the ground at only a 6-to-1 ratio with gold... and most of that is getting snapped up by industrial users (electronics). This price suppression is helpful to us in the meantime as we trade our fiat currency for silver to preserve our wealth. <br>
 <br>
You can expect silver to hit at least the classic 16-to-1 ratio with gold fairly soon as the US dollar goes into an increased inflation rate... probably to 25% early next year. So if gold goes to $5000, you can expect silver to hit $312 an ounce. We&#039;re getting close to that tipping point.
        </p> Coins have two values, the face value that the issuing government has placed on the coins and the collector&#039;s value.   A investment in coins is an investment in the collector&#039;s value but the collector&#039;s value is dependent on what a buyer is willing to pay for it.   In essence coins have low liquidity and hence make poor investments, certainly with respect to something like stocks. <br>
 <br>
With just a few hundred dollars, you&#039;re probably looking at something like a CD or Bonds for safe investments.
        </p> Investing in coins is much more riskier than stocks.   A coin doesn&#039;t have to go up in value..... if it does it doesn&#039;t have to go up enough to meet inflation.   Certainly some will..... but you may not know that for 10-25 years or more. <br>
 <br>
There is nothing in our history that has performed as well as the stock market. Certainly better than gold or coins. Perhaps it&#039;s time to buy some books and learn about it.
        </p> At 17 a few hunderd dollars are for buying things that make you happy. If 1/2 ounce of gold will make you happy then go for it. It ain&#039;t gonna make you rich, son.
