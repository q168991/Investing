</script><p> Learn the Dos and Don&#039;ts of the Stock Market.  The best way to do that is by ensuring that you do a lot of reading from various advisory sites.   <br>
 <br>
ICICIDIRECT.COM has some good info on it.   <br>
***suzeorman*** has good info on investing in stocks and funds.  <br>
 <br>
Reading balance sheets is a critical skill that one needs to gain to evaluate how a company is doing.  This will make you a fundamental investor.   <br>
 <br>
Alternatively, you can do it by learning about chart patterns.  This will give you the feel of Demand and Supply in 100&#039;s of different ways. This will make you a Technician.   <br>
 <br>
And, if nothing works out well, start with mutual funds, and then enter the stock market, very slowly.   <br>
 <br>
I am a fundamentalist as well as a chartist (technician).  I find good quality stocks (fundamentally), and then buy when the chart tells me to do so, and sell it when the chart tells me to do so.   <br>
 <br>
Good luck.  <br>

        </p> Ok here is the point.  I give you 5000 yahoo fantasy dollars. <br>
   You decide to fill one folder that is 5 choices.  Sooooo  the <br>
    combinations of all possible stocks is staggering is it not? <br>
   So here is the clue, someone has laws of pay outs.  Then you <br>
    must simply fulfill the criteria.  Say you chose aluminum, oil, <br>
     gold, toys, and fabrics.  All busy right.  Tho now the point is <br>
     accuracy.  Those payouts are not active, based now in gold <br>
    and long term.  How is that you say?  The function is there is <br>
    a line of investments way ahead of you, truly big spending in <br>
    that set.  Ahhh do you believe me?  Second points service you <br>
    now need to associate your spending, why do you need money?  ok rules,  stock money profit people foreign banks ahh <br>
    your not paying taxes are you , not with my stock profits it is <br>
    illegal.   Soooo.  Tight budgetting is now a cause, spend trade <br>
    use spreading across present business shares of your own right?  Well first of all you must know your cap.  How much are you allowed to have, to spend, to invest nearby, to use for others. <br>
The point ends up with you need to do financial expert schedules <br>
  to get a strong return.  Want a bologna return and bigshot hide <br>
   outs in florida?  then you need join a team investment.  This <br>
   goes on into various ways to spend, so get set for the news. A <br>
  good investor is allowed to spend all through the civilized bank <br>
   system holdings.  Buy a Hawaiin island, or a farm in minnesota <br>
   are good buys, cheap nowadays, only operational costs.  SO  <br>
   the portfolio is What do you do with your stock profitting fund. <br>
  Read some good analyst news with strong spending for ideas. <br>
  Then set a loss limit, like say 20,000 investment, and go for fast <br>
   high returns.  You need attend where you are for solid manage <br>
    team that simply says yes, andrew has good investments. That is the true profit for good stock action.  All the steps up are <br>
   with the spoken word.  Start with looking at my suggested small <br>
   line say get looking at 5000 caps.  I will be there, with a 25 trillion  diamond space gateway, from this same place. <br>
