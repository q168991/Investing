</script><p> It depends on your strategy (capital growth or dividend pay out), what type of stock you are investing in and how long you hold on.  If you go for high risk /high reward stocks them only invest what you can afford to lose.  Otherwise invest in a balanced portofolio and hold on for capital growth

</script><p> Stay out of the stock market until mid next year. No one know for sure, but the economy seems to be slowing... that means most investmenst will start to lose value. In the long term, this doesn&#039;t matter, but i wouldn&#039;t start investing just yet. <br>
 <br>
put your money in a 3 month CD (in any fdic insured bank) and then in march, when it comes due, see how the economy is doing. If not good, then wait another 3 months.
        </p> Better make overseas investment. <br>
 <br>
You will get a 13% rate of interest in Belarusian banks. NO RISK AT ALL because all deposits are state insured.  <br>
Or lend your money privately to Belarusian entrepreneurs who will pay you over 30% interest per year. Very low risk and high rate of return. <br>
 <br>

Good luck!
        </p> It rather depends on how much you have to invest. <br>
The Stock Market carries good returns ,but also carries risks.
