</script><p> Investing is what you do when you put your money to work in the hope of getting a return (more money out than what you put in). Your best investment is the one you make for yourself by getting an education. You&#039;ll pay for an education with your time and money but you can expect to earn a great deal more money over your lifetime (millions, in fact).  <br>
 <br>
People invest in business, stocks and bonds in the hopes that their invested money will grow over time. The potential for really good returns often is better than doing nothing with your money.

Besides what the dictionary says, consider this simple analogy. If I take a seed and plant it, provide the conditions to help it sprout and grow, then when it grows, if it grows, then I may gain the intended benefit. If I grow a tree, I might want it for shade, or perhaps as part of several others to be a fence or wall from wind, or prying eyes of the neighbors, or perhaps to gain fruit every year, or maybe even so I can cut it down for the lumber or merely firewood. This is investing. If you like the way Wendys works better than McDonalds, buy Wendys stock, or McDonalds if your preference is there. If you think Penny&#039;s is better than Target, or perhaps think Wal-Mart does a better business. Invest in your preference of these. If you commonly buy your gas at an Exxon-Mobile station chain, or rather prefer Conoco-Phillips, or even BP or Shell, you might consider owning a piece of one or more of these. If you think that agriculture is big and growing, then look at Monsanto or perhaps ADM. Investing isn&#039;t really interested in the same things as traders watch. You almost don&#039;t even need to worry about the price of the stock because if the company continues to do what it does well and profits, then the intrinsic value will swell. In the long run, that means your investment becomes like that tree, it has grown and gained fruit. That is investing.

        </p> What Does Invest Mean
        </p> Investment or investing[1] is a term with several closely-related meanings in business management, finance and economics, related to saving or deferring consumption. An asset is usually purchased, or equivalently a deposit is made in a bank, in hopes of getting a future return or interest from it. The word originates in the Latin &quot;vestis&quot;, meaning garment, and refers to the act of putting things (money or other claims to resources) into others&#039; pockets. See Invest. The basic meaning of the term being an asset held to have some recurring or capital gains. It is an asset that is expected to give returns without any work on the asset per se
        </p> Putting something in to get a greater amount out. <br>
 <br>
Normally money. E.g you can invest $10k in a business in the hope that if it gets going you will get that money back + more from the profits. <br>
 <br>
But you can also invest other things like time. Returns are normally money but you might for example invest time in your girlfriend for emotional rewards.
