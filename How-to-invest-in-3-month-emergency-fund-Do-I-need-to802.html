<h1>How to invest in 3 month emergency fund? Do I need to?</h1>
<div class="answer">For now I am mainly responsible for student loan bills:
I pay :
$158 monthly for federal 20,000 6.7% graduate plan
$528 for private chase student loan (min $264 required) 2.75% 21,000 + 9.30% 15,0000
$137 AES private 3.85% 22,000 - min for now

I plan soon to increase to $1000 or more for Chase loan.

I pay around $70-$80 a month for cell phone bill and $80 for my own individual health insurance (I have extra from work but I don&amp;#39;t want to loose my own just in case, COBRA expensive).

I receive $42,000 per year.

In addition, I am putting out $200 monthly for fund travel (cheap travel to florida this winter) and $50-100 for HSA. I need to put some savings for medical tests which may cost me $2000 and I will need to do this year, preferably as soon as possible. I may probably qualify for a financing from hospital. Hopefully with no interest

I pay $20 monthly for generic long term and $176 for brand short-term 6 months (although I plan to switch to canadian mail or other internet mail to save more, NO GENERIC). 

Credit CARD DEBT (my priority) $2600 for 2 credit cards. I pay off one with $500 and second $200 monthly. 


I get paid $630 weekly. With my expenses I don&amp;#39;t have much left for savings, but perhaps I could squeeze some? After I pay off CC, I plan to save more for emergency fund and/or increase payments for student loans. 


Perhaps if I over pay student loans for few months (double amount), I may qualify for few months of deferment in case I loose job?

its probably never too late to start building emergency fund but is it wise to invest them in mutual funds or bonds once I accumulate some (like $1000)? CDs and &amp;quot;high yield&amp;quot; savings pay terrible low interest.Then I would just simply add more monthly (like $100).<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> an emergency fund, by definition, is a very liquid asset that does not lose value. cash in a savings account is one of the best. next would be a short term CD, but you could get an early withdrawal penalty if you end up needing it before maturity. everything else is an investment that is riskier that could lose value.

</script><p> There is no question that savings accounts barely pay any interest but the advantage is liquidity. You can go to an ATM and make a withdrawal immediately. So it is a trade off. I would suggest a combination approach. Put a month or two into a savings account available for immediate withdrawal and invest the remainder in an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) that is indexed to a market such as the S &amp; P 500 instead of a mutual fund. An ETF is very liquid and allows you to sell immediately. Understand that there is no guarantee that the S &amp;P will go up but most ETF&#039;s do earn interest based on thew underlying stocks. Set up an online brokerage account that does not charge maintenance fees and does not require minimum balances. Disclaimer: Any individual who chooses to invest in any securities should do so with caution. Investing in securities is speculative and carries a high degree of risk; you may lose some or all of the money that is invested. Always research your own investments or consult with a registered investment adviser or licensed stock broker before investing.

 <br>
Everyone who has bills needs an emergency fund. <br>
You put it in a regular bank&#039;s regular savings account. <br>
