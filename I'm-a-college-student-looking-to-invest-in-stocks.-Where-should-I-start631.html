<div class="answer">I&amp;#39;m not ready to buy just yet, as I am still reading and learning about stocks and whatnot, but I&amp;#39;m just curious, how does one start?

</script><p> Start with some basic books to teach you the fundamentals. Two excellent reads are The Complete Idiot&#039;s Guide to Investing and Investing for Dummies. Before doing anything, make sure you have enough in savings in case things go south for at least 6 months.  <br>
 You need to learn also some important concepts in investing, such as dollar-cost averaging and compound interest - two of your best friends to make money for the future. <br>
 The amount you need to start varies with the place you invest at, as well as the stock or fund.  <br>
 You first need to pick a company to invest through. Some of the best are Vanguard, T. Rowe Price, Fidelity, and Schwab. Avoid the big banks like the plague. Don&#039;t let them rip you off with loads (sales charges) and fees. Check how much the company charges you as an expense ratio. A good one might charge you 0.2-0.8 %. If they charge more than 1% than go somewhere else. And if they charge any kind of 12b-1 fee, hold on to your wallet and RUN. <br>
 The question you need to answer is WHY you are investing. Different people have different goals. Is it for more income? For retirement? For your education? Plus how long do you want to invest? How much risk are you willing to assume? <br>
 <br>
These are all very critical questions and they will determine what kind of investments are right for you. Don&#039;t believe anyone who has a &quot;one size fits all&quot; kind of investment. For stocks typically you are talking about at least a 5 year investment period. If less, consider getting into bonds or a bond fund instead. Many people choose an appropriate mix of the two. <br>
 If you want to get into the market but don&#039;t know what stock to pick, consider an index fund or ETF. Instead of throwing all your eggs into one basket (one company), index funds can invest you in dozens, hundreds, or thousands of companies all at once and so there is less risk. This protects you if any one company or industry runs into trouble. For bonds, the returns are less, but more solid. <br>
 If you are thinking of retirement, consider a Roth IRA. Your money grows tax free, and when you retire you can withdraw it tax free as well. Quite the contrary to the above, if you have enough living expenses socked away as well as for tuition, books etc it is *never* too early to start saving for retirement. With just a little money and 50 years you can get a sizable nest egg to retire on. And many people will likely be living far longer in the future and will need much more money to live 15-25 years or even more after retirement.  <br>
For more information, try looking at <br>
https://personal.vanguard***/us/funds/v... <br>
and play with it, comparing funds with more or less risk. <br>
 <br>
Do some reading online such as  <br>
http://***vanguard***/us/insights  for some important truths about investing.

RE: <br>
I&amp;#39;m a college student looking to invest in stocks. Where should I start? <br>
I&amp;#39;m not ready to buy just yet, as I am still reading and learning about stocks and whatnot, but I&amp;#39;m just curious, how does one start? Is it a good idea for a college student to invest in the stock market? How much money does one normally need to start?
        </p> The minimum account with TD Ameritrade is $500.  It is a great idea for a college student to invest but you must know your goals and how much risk you will undertake to reach those goals.  Many college students cannot afford to lose money so their goal might be prevervation of capital. <br>
One good way to learn about investing is to do paper trades.  There are online platforms that will allow you to do this, but pencil and paper work fine too.  Don&#039;t know what stocks to practice on?  If you have a Blackberry, try investing in RIMM, or if you have an Iphone, invest in Apple.  Choose stocks from various sectors so your paper portfolio is diversified: energy, financial, healthcare, etc.  When you have a chosen a company, you can visit its website and look under &quot;Investor Relations&quot; for information like the dividends it may pay, financial reports, stock splits, upcoming events like shareholder meetings, and more.
        </p> A plan with higher fees, higher minimum investments and higher future investments might be the best direct-stock purchase plan for you. If you firmly believe that XYZ Company is the best stock to purchase, don&#039;t allow the differences in fees to be a deterrent. If you can&#039;t afford the minimum purchase (some as high as $2,500), use an inexpensive brokerage service rather than the direct-stock purchase program. Remember, no matter how much of a bargain you get, the goal is to select a stock that grows in value <br>
 <br>
And don&#039;t forget to give yourself time to read and learn everythings about stock. <br>
Good luck
        </p> Good plan and perspective.  <br>
 <br>
Go to library.  Read every financial magazine they have there.  Select one or two.  Go into the archives and pull up 12 of the last issues and read them. (keep notes) From that knowledge base go to Yahoo Finance and open several portfolios.  Link each portfolio to a specific strategy.  Let&#039;s say, heavy industries during phase 2 of the business cycle and consumer cyclicals during phase 2.  Watch the performance of the portfolios, figure out when the next phase comes, adjust the strategies for a time phase.  After one full business cycle, normally 4 years, check the performance of each of your portfolios.   <br>
 <br>
Phase in. Start with good named mutual funds and ETFs.  Vanguard is a very good operation with a broad range of options.  Most important to your future performance, Vanguard has very low costs on their ETFs and Mutual funds.   <br>
 <br>
At this stage of your life, you need access to your money for things like new car, new house, new stuff.  That means instruments like IRA and Roth which require you devote the money long term, like till you retire are not appropriate.
        </p> You can open a Scottrade for as little as $500. <br>
 <br>
Yes, it is a good idea, especially at your age, stocks have outperformed almost all investments over the long term. Also, educate yourself: watch CNBC and Bloomberg, also buy Investors Business Daily or the Wall Street Journal at least twice a week or read them at the library. <br>
 <br>
Good luck starting your investment career!

        </p> Momentum investing is what you need to learn about.  You can start with a small amount of money and build from there.  But it&#039;s very important to buy at the right time and sell at the right time.
