</script><p> Something with a high Rate of Capital Employed (ROCE). I had a Business National lesson the other day and learned that Halfords has a ROCE of 60%! Avoid businesses like Apple, however, as their ROCE is lower than that of many banks, meaning you&#039;d be better off putting the £2k in the bank than investing in Apple. Hope this helps! :)

</script><p> Raysor&#039;s is a good answer, but oil exploration is a bit hit and miss and some companies have had share prices fall recently as exploration was unsuccessful, but I&#039;d either hold off until shares fall again, as they will do soon in the next few months or I&#039;d invest in gold or some of the smaller gold companies that are waiting for exploration results, like Goldstone Resourses. <br>

        </p> You can invest in banking industry because since the market tumbled in the year 2008. Banks meltdown, now they are recover already but yet to reach their historical high in 2008. The banking industries will have to consolidate a while and rise again once they start to stabilize like the current market.
        </p> hi friend !! <br>
 <br>
Im currently trading at gnuTrade online trading platform and there the minimum amount to deposit is only £20, €20, or $30, and you can place trades for as little as 10p per point, or 50p for a basic bet. You can also take advantage of their first deposit bonus promotion and try playing trading games with real money. <br>
 <br>
good luck friend!!
        </p> I suppose I would go for oil. Falklands or North Sea. Rockhopper, Desire, Gulf Keystone maybe.
