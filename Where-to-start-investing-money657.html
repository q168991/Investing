<h1>Where to start investing money?</h1>
<div class="answer">I have been saving money for a few years and all i have done is have a bank cd which makes me about $100 a month, I have about $40,000 total saved up, and i just want to know if anyone can give any detailed ways or places i can invest money, I&amp;#39;m just looking to get started and am also interested in numbers like how much i can make in so many years etc... how much can i be expected to get , percentages etc... but mostly just how to get started. i&amp;#39;ve looked into stocks but dont quite understand it just yet<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> You&#039;ve got enough money that you might want to consider hiring an investment adviser.  He or she will be able to explain to you in a bit more detail how investing works.  Essentially you have a few basic options. <br>
 <br>
1) Bank CDs - Very low yield.  100% safe. <br>
2) Corporate Bonds - 5%-10% yield.  Possibility that a company will go bankrupt, default on your bonds, and you will lose a part of your investment. <br>
3) Stocks - 10% plus.  Over the short term the stock market rises and falls dramatically.  Over the long term (10 years or more) it will dominate all other investment alternatives.   <br>
 <br>
If you don&#039;t want to get into learning how to select your own stocks and bonds (this will take a lot of time and effort) then look into mutual funds or index funds (unmanaged mutual funds that simply invest in a single stock index). <br>
 <br>
Again consult an investment adviser about the basics.  You can find them in a phone book or at your local bank.  Don&#039;t let them rope you into making too many consultations or paying too many fees though.  They should just select a mutual fund, bond fund, or index fund that will work for you.  Simple as that.

</script><p> It sounds like you don&#039;t have a lot of risk tolerance. <br>
 <br>
So the best place to invest is CD&#039;s and Bonds.  You wouldn&#039;t be able to sleep at night if you put money into stocks due to their volatility. <br>
 <br>
Since you&#039;re already in CD&#039;s, you might want to try Bonds.  There are many types of bonds: Treasury Bonds, Corporate Bonds, Municipal Bonds, probably more I can&#039;t remember off top of my head. <br>
 <br>
Bonds are usually very safe (although not risk-free). The safest bond (as believed by most investors) are United States Treasury Bonds. The government is always looking for cash, and they will pay a decent interest rate for it. You can &quot;lend&quot; them your cash when you feel like the interest rate on it is satisfactory. Municipal Bonds are almost the same, except it&#039;s the cities and local things of nature. <br>
 <br>
Then there&#039;s corporate bonds, companies also looking to pay you interest so they can borrow your cash as well. It can be a hard decision to get these type of bonds because you have to figure out for yourself if the company may go bankrupt in the future, because if they do and they have your money, they will probably default and not be able to pay you back.  <br>
 <br>
Of course, if you learned how to evaluate companies, you can mitigate risk a lot, then you can get stocks. But that&#039;s up to you and how motivated you are about learning how to do it. I think its worth it.
        </p> Educate yourself thoroughly about the type of investment you have in mind. This will (eventually) enable you to make your own informed decisions instead of relying on a supposed &quot;expert&quot; to handle investments for you. Be patient in this process: do not commit real money until you are genuinely convinced that you know what you are doing. If you choose to invest in stocks via a mutual fund so that you will not have to do research in great detail, at least spend the time and effort necessary to research mutual funds thoroughly. It is not only their past performances that have significant differences.
        </p> instead of asking people on here for their opinions, I would recommend you find your nearest Fidelity Brokerage and talk to one of their advisors.  It will take about 30 min to an hour and they will assess your risk tolerance and goals and make an unbiased recommendation on what you can do with your money.  Best part about it is...its free.  I am currently with Fidelity and find they have excellent customer service and they are not too pushy.  Best of luck.
