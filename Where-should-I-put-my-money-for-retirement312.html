<h1>Where should I put my money for retirement?</h1>
<div class="answer">I&amp;#39;m 22 years old. My mind is completely set on growing a nest egg because I have realized the power of compound interest and initial capital. I have set aside a specific amount that I plan on never touching til I retire. I&amp;#39;ve considered many options and currently am using a moderate growth etf portfolio with Amerivest. I do not have time to study the market and invest in my own stocks as I have done in recent past.
My concern is actual returns on my investment. I have known people to lose money even in a bullish market with a broker managed account. The only difference I know of with Amerivest is that they use morningstar advisors and do not pick funds which they manage themselves. APY is estimated 10% for my growth model, not including .9% fee.
Anyone have suggestions for me for where to invest? I&amp;#39;ve heard of Roth IRA, traditional IRA, mirrortraded accounts, selfinvesting in etfs, etc. I have enough time that I feel I can just buy and hold my own etfs for life, but I&amp;#39;m mostly concerned with preserving capital.
I realize patience is key with any investment, but I don&amp;#39;t want to see my Amerivest portfolio red in 2 years when I reevaluate my investments.

</script><p> First off, two thumbs up for thinking about retirement savings. To start putting away at age 22 is going to add up in the end. <br>
 <br>
At age 22 I wouldn&#039;t be too concerned about how your investments does in 2 years....you have 35+ years until retirement so you are in for the long haul. As past charts of the market shows everything goes up in the long run with lots of ups and down in between, it&#039;s how you handle the ups and down which is key. I would say at age 22 you can take on a bit more risk but I would suggest taking an assessment on yourself too see what your risk tolerance are. <br>
 <br>
I am in Canada so it is tough for me to recommend where to invest but as I mention see what your risk tolerance is and see what you are comfortable with. Remember to diversify! BOL

</script><p> I think you are going in the right direction. Maybe I would try and diversify through different ETFs and not too much diversity within each ETF. The moderate growth ETF sounds good, maybe you could have a high growth one as well, a developing economy ETF or even a corporate bond etf for a bit of stability. You just have to get your percentages right. Even the specialist funds , for example, technology ETF. Once the portfolio has grown then maybe you should look at single stocks portfolio managed bya broker. You should look at the Portfolio, maybe quarterly or half yearly to reappraise and re-jig the protfolio if necessary. I don&#039;t know about US but here in UK there are various ways to avoid taxation on part of the protfolio. That is we can wrap an ETF in an ISA, Individual Savings Account,(free of CGT and income tax) or a SIPP (Self invested Pension Plan). i am sure there are simolar thinks in the States. <br>
As well as compound interest there is the power of equities. A company, by its nature, is designed for growth. Its directors usually benefit from ots growth so a well managed business with good products and services has every chance of success. Of course there are lots that don&#039;t and sometimes the market as a whole takes a dive. But with a bit of prudence and control a well constructed and well managed portfolio should easily avoid the worst scenarios.
        </p> I&#039;d avoid companies like Amerivest.   The fees are high &amp; I think it&#039;s irresponsible at best to say there&#039;s a 10% annual long term rate (granted estimated... but still implied).  This portfolio smells of Market Timing  and paying .90% above the ETF&#039;s cost is.... (again) very costly. <br>
 <br>
Over the long term this is more expensive than &quot;A&quot; shares from most loaded fund.... and I&#039;m not a fan of loaded funds.  I don&#039;t like broker accounts or so called managed accounts (and yours sounds like its got elements of a managed account). <br>
 <br>
Then there&#039;s the issue of IRA&#039;s (ROTH and Traditional).  These are the vechicles to carry investments. They are not investments. You could have your Ameritrust inside a ROTH IRA (not that I&#039;m suggesting that). <br>
 <br>
&quot;Preserving Capital&quot; is your main goal but you&#039;re in a fund predicting 10% annual growth.  That&#039;s considered more than moderate risk by most. This should never be used for someone who&#039;s main goal is to preserve capital.  The high fees mean you&#039;re portfolio has to earn the rate of return of the ETF fees &amp; the Ameritrust Fees just to break even.  That&#039;s a lot over 40 years. <br>
 <br>
Your statement that you don&#039;t want to see the account go in the red in two years shows absolutely that you have no clue about your current investments or investments in general. <br>
 <br>
You are on the road to killing your portfolio. I don&#039;t have the time to go on.... you need to educate yourself.  You need to read several books on Mutual Funds and investments in general.  This education will pay for itself over your lifetime.  Do it now before you continue making major mistakes based on wrong assumptions. <br>
 <br>
At age 22 you&#039;re totally misinformed to have your main goal as &quot;preserving capital&quot;.  It is.... nuts.
        </p> You should definitely do an IRA because of tax benefits. With a traditional IRA, you can deduct the amount you invest from your taxes, but have to pay for taxes when you withdraw after you reach retirement. With a Roth IRA, you don&#039;t deduct your investments from your taxes, but when you withdraw it after you retire, you don&#039;t pay for taxes for your gains. <br>
 <br>
With your ETF, you have to pay taxes every year on your capital gains. ETF are good for investing and making money, but not as good for retirement. <br>
 <br>
Of course, if your employer offers a 401(k), do it because you put some of your income into it and not have to pay taxes for that income. Also most companies, puts money into your 401(k) based on how much you invest.
        </p> There are four stages of retirement planning. 1. Contribution, 2. Growth, 3. Income, 4. Transfer. Very few advisors discuss the most important stages which are the last two. How is your nest egg going to be taxed when taking retirement income and upon your death how is your nest egg going to transfer to your heirs. <br>
We use a concept called Tax-Free Income Planning. Where you use after tax dollars to fund your retirement account. The growth (which can be tied to an Index providing good returns but more importantly no downside market risk) will grow tax-deferred, your income will be Tax-Free! Upon your death your nest egg will transfer to your heirs with no taxes.
