<h1>What is they best way to start investing money?</h1>
<div class="answer">Should I try a website like etrade or pay a professional to invest my money?  Or is there a better way?  I have no experience in investing.  I already put money into a 401k, but would like to learn and invest myself.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Before you spend $0.01 on any investment, you must know what you’re doing, why you’re doing it and how to do it.  Before you invest in any security, the first investment you should make is in yourself, and the best investment you can make is by educating yourself.  <br>
 <br>
Begin your education by learning why you should invest and the importance of being able to make your own decisions or how the pro’s make theirs. Start your education by reading “Investing or Dummies” by Eric Tyson. <br>
 <br>
NO you should not open a brokerage account any where until you know what you&#039;re doing, especially since you admitted you have no experience with investing. <br>
 <br>
Since you have an 401K account, you should contact the trustee for the plan (your HR office can help you with this).  Have the trustee cover your plan with all your options

</script><p> Putting money into a 401K doesn&#039;t mean you&#039;re doing it correctly.  My vote is to not do a thing until you learn the basics. <br>
 <br>
The most logical place to start is Stock Mutual Funds.   Get some basic books on Mutual Funds (at least 2-3).  This is not going to be painful.  In addition also read 2-3 books on stock investing. <br>
 <br>
Then... you&#039;ll be ready to choose a broker or no load, low fee Mutual Fund company. I&#039;m not a big fan of eTrade.... but you could do worse. Check out TD Ameritrade, Charles Schwab &amp; Fidelity.
        </p> Teach yourself absolutely concerning the variety of investment you&#039;ve gotten in mind. This may (eventually) allow you to make your own told selections as a substitute of counting on a supposed &quot;trained&quot; to handle investments for you. Be sufferer in this approach: do not commit actual money unless you are genuinely satisfied that you know what you might be doing. In case you pick to invest in stocks through a mutual fund in order that you&#039;ll not have got to do study in nice element, at the least spend the effort and time critical to research mutual cash completely. It&#039;s not most effective their previous performances which have massive variations.
        </p> It&#039;s definitely a good idea to open a brokerage account and do the investing yourself. You hardly make any money in mutual fund investing. You can learn how to invest by following experts. Read about Warren Buffet or George Soros. Before opening your account please do your research to find the best broker for your needs as the competition amongst brokerage firms is very high. Make sure you get the best deal. You can use smartmoney*** or thestreet*** to learn more about investing as well.
        </p> Today property values are still low rental property is a safe way to earn money, only problem is to evaluate potential renters before you show the home. land will go back up again. Also invest in gold no matter what happens with our economy it will be there with returns.

pay off all your debt for fastest ROI.
        </p> It is a good decision to manage your own future. Who else could manage it better? Start with a good book like Investing for Dummies, available at your local library for free, and thousands of other volumes. <br>
