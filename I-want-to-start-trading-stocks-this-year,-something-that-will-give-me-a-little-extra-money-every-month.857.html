<h1>I want to start trading stocks this year, something that will give me a little extra money every month.?</h1>
<div class="answer">I have absolutely NO experience whatsoever--very green at this!  What are the steps I have to take?  What broker is best to use or do you suggest that I do it myself?  How do I add money to my account, analyze stock, see how it&amp;#39;s done in person?  I think I would benefit by seeing it done by someone!  Currently, I would like to earn about $500 to $1,000 a month extra from it but, eventually, I would like to do it as my sole income.  I am currently reading,&amp;quot;Teach Yourself Investing in 24 Hours&amp;quot; by Ken Little and will read &amp;quot;A Beginner&amp;#39;s Guide to Day Trading Online&amp;quot; next.  I would like to take some courses at the community college level but not earn a degree at it.  Do you think I am doing the right thing and how might I improve in this process?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Day trading is very risky and very expensive.  I recommend having your money managed by an advisor you can trust at a reputable firm (Merrill, Smith Barney, etc.) or even a local advisory firm.  You will pay extra for it, but it saves you a great deal of time and worry. <br>
 <br>
If you have time to do it yourself, stick to highly rated mutual funds and ETFs.  The key is to be diversified by owning large companies, small companies, bonds, international, etc. in all different industries.  This allows you to be a long term investor and ride out short term volatility.  Mutual funds and ETFs are the best way to accomplish this.

        </p> With &quot;absolutely NO experience whatsoever,&quot; I would suggest you take a serious moment to ask yourself if what you are considering (i.e. Daytrading) is the best thing to do.  I have been investing on my own for 7 years and still consider myself a beginner and I would never risk my money daytrading.  That figure of &quot;$500 to $1000 a month&quot; comes at a price, too.  You&#039;d have to be slinging around some serious cash ($100K or more) or taking those trades on margin, which I cannot stress enough that it isn&#039;t a good idea.  You must remember that each trade, depending on which online or real-live broker you use, can cost you anywhere between $5 and $30.  Then there&#039;s the taxes that are 30% of the money you get from selling (not just the profits) if you sell in the short term (less than 365 days, I believe).   <br>
My suggestion:  Go to the library, ask the librarians to help you find articles about all those guys in 2000 and 2001 who lost everything daytrading and went nuts and shot up the places they were daytrading at.  Then ask yourself if you want to risk it.
        </p> Nothing wrong with getting involved with the market but make sure you treat your trades like a business not a hobby.  Many investors go to books for information but not all of the tricks of the trade are taught. Investors Business Daily is a great source to review, but day trading is the quickest way to losing money for the inexperienced. For now Focus on winners and invest in what you know and understand.  Also check out some sites that offer trading selection services, but first identify what style of trading will work for you.  For example, are you a long term holder meaning a year or more or are you a swing trader, holding time from 2 weeks to 3 months and so on.  Once you address your style then you will start your journey with the stock market..

        </p> Good god, stay away from day trading.  People have lost their shirts, doing that, and I hope any decent how-to book on investing would strongly discourage it. <br>
 <br>
Do a lot more studying before you start to trade stocks.  Seeing all of the questions you don&#039;t know the answers to, you&#039;re not ready to trade stocks, yet.  Go to the bookstore, and read as many books on investing as you can.  Read Forbes Magazine, Fortune, and The Wall Street Journal, if you want to eventually make this your sole source of income.   <br>
 <br>
I am not ready to trade stocks yet, either.  I have bought shares in mutual funds--one for retirement, and one in the healthcare sector, whose purpose is to, as you said, gain some extra income.   <br>
 <br>
I invest with Schwab, but I&#039;m sure any of the other investment houses are also good.  Just be sure to pick a place that pays its employees salaries and not commissions.
        </p> First you should just study the market for about six months to a year so that you develop a sixth sense about it... and believe me you will develop a feel for it. Dont believe anyone without doing your own due diligence. <br>
Please do not believe the BS espewed by the likes of CNN or Forbes or any of the main line media. They are followers not predictors of the future economy. <br>
Do not day trade until you have  learned to trade on a longer time frame. Most people lose when day trading. <br>
Study both fundamentals and charts.  <br>
Right now is a very volatile time for the markets so it is a great time to study and observe them but a risky time to invest. <br>
Here is a great unbiased  site for any investor. Read the editorials by  people who have been in the business for  years. <br>
http://***financialsense***/index.html
        </p> any internet broker is good, I&#039;m using for years etrade <br>
after you open acount you send check to etrade. for earning $500/mont you have to: invest a lot or risk hi, <br>
Try to buy cheap stock with hig dividents first. <br>
for example BTO $6. after a year return 18% <br>
even if it goes down you earn, You could lern everything you self by spending same time, following, the news, and reading explanations from brokers on line. Good luck Janusz
        </p> the best trading software http://tradingsolution.info <br>
i have attended a lot of seminars, read counless books on forex trading and it all cost me thousands of dollars. the worst thing was i blew up my first account. after that i opened another account and the same thing happened again. i started to wonder why i couldn,t make any money in forex trading. at first i thought i knew everything about trading. finally i found that the main problem i have was i did not have the right mental in trading. as we know that psychology has great impact on our trading result. apart from psychology issue, there is another problem that we have to address. they are money management, market analysis, and entry/exit rules. to me money management is important in trading. i opened another account and start to trade profitably after i learnt from my past mistake. i don&#039;t trade emotionally anymore.  <br>
if you are serious about trading you need to address your weakness and try to fix it. no forex guru can make you Professional trader unless you want to learn from your mistake.
        </p> As with everything of value, you must master the basics. You must understand the basic economy and investing strategies. <br>
 <br>
There is no other way then through the hard work of learning I can show you what and how to learn, the rest is up to you. <br>
 <br>
Step 1.  <br>
First decide what kind of brokerage you want to work with. You can open a brokerage account in your bank,  <br>
with a large full service brokerage or an internet brokerage. I find when I get help, most people want to sell me  <br>
things that are better for them then they are for me…. So I use http://***scottrade*** because it’s cheap and  <br>
easy with low frills. I like their streaming quotes and I do my own research and make my own investments. But  <br>
any low cost internet brokerage service is fine. <br>
 <br>
Step 2. get a subscription to Barrons or Investors Business Daily… Don&#039;t worry about the cost, and don’t skip  <br>
this step. Do this for at least 6 months or a year. At first, It seems a bit mysterious, but pretty soon you start to  <br>
understand the terms and things that investors are looking for and what they are afraid of. <br>
 <br>
Step 3. If you have some money to invest, put it in 3 month CD’s right now. First the market is unstable and second you have some homework in Step 4 to do before you do any investing. <br>
 <br>
Step 4. Go out to the internet and search on the following subjects. Become very familiar with the concepts. <br>
Asset allocation  <br>
Long term investing <br>
asset correlation <br>
dollar cost averaging <br>
inflation   <br>
Roth ira vs ira <br>
Large med small cap stocks <br>
Value vs growth stocks <br>
Indexed funds <br>
No load mutual funds <br>
ETF (also ETN and CEF all similar but with special differences) <br>
Sector funds <br>
Bonds, CD, preferred stock <br>
dividends <br>
International funds <br>
emerging markets <br>
commodities <br>
Market cycles <br>
volatility <br>
Fundamental analysis <br>
Technical analysis <br>
Life insurance term vs whole  <br>
In most cases, I think it is wise to use indexed mutual funds and ETF to build the base of your portfolio. <br>
 <br>
Step 5 go to http://clearstation.etrade***/ and sign up for a free account. Play around there by looking at  <br>
graphs and fundamentals. If you click on the graph names, you will get clear information about what the graph  <br>
is based on and how to interpret it. I think it’s also a good idea to pretend you have $10,000 and start buying  <br>
and selling on paper. Keep track of where you are each day for a month… It’s a lot easier to lose play money then real money…. <br>
WARNING: don’t rely on technical analysis alone. These graphs are good at telling you WHEN to buy and sell, but now Whether or WHAT to buy. <br>
 <br>
Step 6. It’s always a good Idea to see a CFP (certified financial planner) especially if you have a family. But be sure to go to one who charges a fee, rather then one who gets paid a commission on your investments. Their job is to work for your benefit, not to sell you investments. They can cover subjects like employee benefits, insurance, budgeting, living trusts, 401k, taxes and real estate as well as investment types and investment types to keep away from.  <br>
But you can buy the CFP study guide at any book store and learn a lot about those topics yourself. <br>
 <br>
Always strive to do your own research… you’ll find everyone sounds like an expert so take everything people tell you with a grain of salt. It’s not easy in the beginning but soon you will be the expert. <br>
 <br>
Don’t get involved with day trading, futures, currency, options (unless you get stock options at work), commodities, annuities or other derivative type investments at this time. Wait unitl you have some experience. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Good Luck
