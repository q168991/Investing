<h1>How can I learn how to invest money in stocks?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am turning 18 pretty soon and would not only like to be able to know how to invest money in stocks, but to also learn how to invest my money in general. Are there any good websites, books, CDs, ect that anyone could recommend for myself to get a leg up?

Any advice would be helpful also

</script><p> I would suggest &quot;The Intelligent Investor&quot; by Benjamin Graham.  This is used as a college text book in courses on security analysis.  He also wrote another text book on the same subject with a different approach with a man whose name was Dodd.  I would also suggest that you read the weekly newspaper, Barrons or the daily Wall Street Journal.  They are available at the public library for free.  You might also wish to study Value Line Services in the reference section of your public library.  This is updated weekly.  Oh, by the way, I believe that according to Federal law, you will not be able to trade until you are 21.

        </p> You are a beginner in stock market. First advice from my side is to read a lot about the stock market. What is it, how many sections they have and so on. When you read all these things then you will be able to understand the market and you can select your area of interests, where you want to trade. Online search is the best option to read. For reading you can go through the investopedia, money control etc which are available easily. For more advice to invest in stock market, go to http://***mmfsolutions***/services/equity/stock-tips/ .

        </p> You can find some good info online, but the best way to learn is to be mentored by someone who has had success in investing.  This may be hard to find, but will be worth whatever you have to do to locate this person. <br>
 <br>
also, start out by practice trading with fake money.  You can get a these simulated accounts at several brokers online.
        </p> You can make money in binary options only if you treat it as a real form of investing. Learn here https://tr.im/2QOmS <br>
 <br>
This means learning how it works, learning how to read charts and learning how you can make accurate predictions. All these are not that difficult but it takes some time. If you treat it as gambling and just make random predictions then you will obviously not win.
        </p> Two books I would recomend. Rule#1 and Trading for dummies. I would also recomend looking at MSN Money and Fool***. Just remember do your homework or research on the company you are interested in and only invest in what you know and not what you don&#039;t know about. Good luck!

i have attended a lot of seminars, read counless books on forex trading and it all cost me thousands of dollars. the worst thing was i blew up my first account. after that i opened another account and the same thing happened again. i started to wonder why i couldn,t make any money in forex trading. at first i thought i knew everything about trading. finally i found that the main problem i have was i did not have the right mental in trading. as we know that psychology has great impact on our trading result. apart from psychology issue, there is another problem that we have to address. they are money management, market analysis, and entry/exit rules. to me money management is important in trading. i opened another account and start to trade profitably after i learnt from my past mistake. i don&#039;t trade emotionally anymore.  <br>
if you are serious about trading you need to address your weakness and try to fix it. no forex guru can make you Professional trader unless you want to learn from your mistake.
