</script><p> First off no website will give you enough information to trade wisely. Its not a quick formula you pick up and set it and for get it. Yahoo or Google search for articles about the &quot;Efficient Market Hypothesis&quot; .  <br>
 <br>
If you believe totally in the theory then learn all you can about index mutual funds and ETF&#039;s and buy the ones you like don&#039;t waste your time with stocks. <br>
 <br>
If you think the theory is hog wash or only partially true, then you work is cut out for you. Do research on Warren Buffet and his mentor Benjamin Graham. These guys are the Ben Ken-obi and Master Yoda of finance. If you listen to what they say you can begin to formulate your own risk profiles towards investments and discover what a fair price is for any given stock.  <br>
 <br>
If that wets your appetite take a stock investment class at a local university. Try out some of on line stock market simulators or build a dummy portfolio on Yahoo and see how well you do before you throw all your money into the ring.
        </p> If you want to learn about investing and the stock market, I would suggest you study what the best investors are buying and selling.  You can find this info at http://***top10traders*** - this is a free site that lets you create a portfolio of stocks with $100,000 in &quot;play&quot; money.  Each day the site ranks the best performing portfolios, so you can see how your picks perform compared to other investors.  You can also read posts on investing from the best traders, as well as share your own investing ideas.  There is also a charting feature , so you can see how your portfolio performs compared to the S&amp;P 500. <br>
 <br>
Here are this month&#039;s best traders: <br>

Good luck.
        </p> First of all, good for you for wanting to start investing. <br>
The sooner you do, the faster, in the long-term, you will accomplish your goals in life. <br>
I started in the same position as you did 4 years ago, I&#039;m now in my mid-twenties. <br>
I started with about 1000$, enough that you care, not enough that you can seriously hurt yourself learning how to manage a portfolio. <br>
Depending on your age and your situation, don&#039;t worry too much about a so-called &quot;emergency fund&quot; 3-6 months of income. <br>
You could easily buy a conservative investment and sell it if you need the money, right? <br>
Check out TD Waterhouse. tdwaterhouse.ca <br>
I&#039;ve dealt with them from the start and am very satisfied with the research tools they have.
        </p> First of all, I would suggest you read up on handling personal finance - there may be better ways of using your money than putting it into stocks. For example - you should have an emergency fund set up (3 to 6 months living expenses), and money set aside for known expenses (next car, etc.). Also read up on investing before you do anything - be prepared to invest for the long term - five years or more, before you expect to make money back.
        </p> choices are aplenty when it comes to investing... one such is currency trading and available in 24 hrs a day... there are also many systems available in the market to provide tips as well but do observe their terms and conditions.. take a look at http://***prosignal-forex***/index.php?ref=1342 for example.  hope this helps!
        </p> yup! best idea in your situation and your situation is fine.......is to paper-trade with fake money and read Technical Analysis books, preferably the one by Edwards and Magee but read this one first: <br>
http://***amazon***/Rule-Freakin-Marke... <br>
 <br>
maybe by the time you have some money you&#039;ll have some reliable knowlege to not lose it.
        </p> Try ***fool***.  They have a free discussion of how to start.
        </p> Seen em all, SCOTTRADE hands down !
