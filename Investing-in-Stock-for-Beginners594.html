<h1>Investing in Stock for Beginners?</h1>
<div class="answer">Hi There,
Does anyone have any general advice on how to begin investing in the stock market. I would be more  comfortable doing business in person. What brokerage firm has a great reputation? What would I expect to pay for their services? Thanks in advance for any feedback and may you have a great New Year ahead! :-)<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> To begin investing, I often recommend avoiding a broker, unless you are comfortable paying broker fees. If you are investing anything under 10,000 dollars, I would suggest broad-indexed mutual funds, like the S&amp;P 500 or similar. If you are looking to start with small amounts, maybe consider broad ETFs. You just want to make sure to diversify and not put it all in one place. US Large Caps, maybe some small caps, Europe and a hint of something else. I wrote a couple of articles covering some basics, http://hubpages***/hub/Investing-For-The-Little-Guys and http://hubpages***/hub/Ideas-For-A-Beginner-Investor. Hope this helps!

</script><p> Interesting Questions : 1) I would not ask you to jump into investing right from Day 1. Since you are starting out with investing, try and learn the basics of investing, when, why and how? demand-supply deals, I wont name any stocks for you friend, all i would say is, dont ask anyone for advice on what to buy and what to sell. It will get you into trouble. The world is full of 100 intelligent people who will give you 100 best stocks, so make the study yourself and work on it. 2)I am quite bad with Fundamental Analysis, so I cant help you on that. 3)Two ways - Fundamental Analysis and Technical Analysis. You will need to google that! See, its not a way to find out which stock will be successful but you sure can identify trends and pick out good buys. I use the latter. 4) How much should you invest? Its simple! Invest only the sum which you are prepared to loose, don&#039;t pump in all your savings. 5) Commodities are the best deal if you are looking to diversify your portfolio. And Gold is the real deal here. And yeah, read, read as much as you can. Give the thing your time, Investing is an art, you need practice before you can master it, though no one has mastered it. A trader or investor has to make losses as he starts off, thats how he learns and makes money. So be prepared for it. Good Luck! Sam
        </p> You will pay 4 to 10 times as much doing business in person instead of using an on-line brokerage account. Before investing in the market, read up: Investing for Dummies from your public library or independent bookseller (also Amazon and BN.COM).
        </p> I agree with the above responder (even though his name is pathetic). <br>
 <br>
Definitely put some time and research into it before you get started. I would tune into CNBC, follow financial news such as the Wall Street Journal or Morningstar, read some books on simple stock investing, margin, options, ETFs, bonds, and so on. If you put a few days into it you&#039;ll get the general idea in no time. <br>
 <br>
Then research for a brokerage firm. I do it online (online is better than in person... but many brokerage firms allow clients to come into the office and discuss trades for free... it all depends on the broker you use) through Schwab and TradeKing. I find Schwab offers very good research material (comparable to Fidelity I&#039;ve heard), but their commissions are high compared to TradeKing. Therefore, I research the material on Schwab and trade on TradeKing :D. <br>
 <br>
Good luck, don&#039;t get too risky... I&#039;ve definitely had my fair share of burns.
        </p> There is this stock exchange online its a simulator so dont worrie about losing money it helped me alot, its ***simexchange***
