</script><p> start by investing in a simple no load mutual fund.  Pick the fund carefully.  READ the prospectus.  Understand it.   You CAN become intelligent in personal finance without an economics degree.

</script><p> There is a huge difference between betting and investing, and the 2 cannot be compared. If you bet on a horse race, go to a casino, or buy a lottery ticket, within moments you either win or lose, that&#039;s it. If you put money into the markets, and what you bought goes down, you do not lose until you actually sell. And there is always the chance the stock, bond, or fund will rise again. Brokerage fees with the advent of the internet have drastically been reduced, so it is not a factor in purchases. True, professional investors may only make 15% yearly, but this is only an average. Some do great, and some fail. If you invest for the long haul, meaning years even decades, your chances assuming you put money into A-rated stocks, will appreciate. Look at Warren Buffet for example. Buy when all is down, put it away, then when life is grand, sell some.
        </p> First read some books and then start investing in the stock market. Reading books is a great way to learn fast about the stock market. You probably will not agree with everything that is said in books but taking bits and pieces out of each book will help you tremendously. <br>
 <br>
Here are some books I think will help: <br>
• How to Make Money in Stocks – William J. O’neil <br>
• The Little Book of Common Sense Investing – John C. Bogle <br>
• One up on Wall Street – Peter Lynch <br>
• Real Money – Jim Cramer <br>
• Reminiscences of a Stock Operator – Edwin Lefevre <br>
• The Intelligent Investor – Benjamin Graham <br>
 <br>
Good luck!
        </p> Im not quite sure but, as for the game and better understanding, there is this website which is like a stock market that you buy and trade items, and you can see your rankings and your gain and losses. For this you will leanr so much more about stocks and you will know better stuff about the idea. All you do is follow the rules, there are just like 2 steps to it. <br>
 <br>
this is the webiste http://vse.marketwatch***/Game/Homepage.aspx <br>
 <br>
and for the directions i will explain what you do, it is vert simple once you get through it, enjoy: <br>
 <br>
-register personal account on that website <br>
- choose a nickname for you  <br>
- enter a zip code <br>
- once registered, click on &quot;find a game to join&quot; on the left side of the screen, and then click on any account <br>
- once the game has commenced, click on &quot;make a trade&quot; to start building your portfolio and buying items.  <br>
-Enter a company that you are interested in buying. then you click on the options that come up, and once you choose the company it will indicate the price, closing price, changes, as well as graph. Then click on buy. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
(the directions may be long, but once you get started on it, it is very simple and fun) you should really give it a try.
        </p> well one of the easiest ways to learn is to &quot;invest&quot; in a couple of  different stocks. <br>
I say &quot;invest&quot; because you are going to pretend you have $5,000.00 to invest, pick a range of different stocks and then invest your $5000.00 by &quot;buying&quot; x amount of stocks in each until you spend your money.  <br>
Then keep track of how your stocks are doing. <br>
If the sell price of the stocks go up you made money if the price goes down you lost money.  Pick a &quot;sell&quot; date (like 90 days) before you buy and then when you &quot;sell&quot; your stock you can see how you did.  I wouldn&#039;t check the prices daily as it will drive you crazy, maybe once a week. <br>
Good luck
        </p> Try daytrading with a game account. If you can make money consistently day-trading, investing money for a profit will be a breeze. Almost all day-traders lose money and almost all investors make money in the end, except some makes much more. If you can succeed where others fail, you will have no problem competing where almost everyone wins.
        </p> so. for around 2-3 weeks &quot;invest&quot; 1 thousand dollars in a stock. Then track it over a couple weeks (dont actually put real mony in btw) and that can help you understand it alot more
        </p> Go to ***investopedia*** and read.  BTW, investing is not &quot;playing&quot;.  Find companies in which you might be interested in investing and follow them--read their annual reports and do research trying to determine if they will do well.  Over the long run, if the company does well, a stockholder of that company will do well.
        </p> there are sights that let you play the stock market for free <br>
 <br>
do that first <br>
 <br>
2nd take your  money and put it into vanguard...if you want to be risky go with the vanguard tototal international index fund <br>
 <br>
you buy and sell individual stocks, you will get burnt!!!! <br>
 <br>
there are always insiders that know more than you <br>
 <br>
mutual funds take away alot of that risk, with nice upside, and downside potential <br>
 <br>
good luck <br>
 <br>
dont buy AMAZON to expensive
        </p> hi <br>
I think you must get involved. Without getting you wont get the &#039;feel&#039;; of cause, not with real money but just play the act like real putting imaginary money. Just get involved like the real thing. This way you&#039;ll get the feel <br>
thanks
