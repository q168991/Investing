<h1>I am 25 years old looking to invest for my retirement since my company does not provide anything.?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am looking for someplace to start investing, i have about $2000 right now that i would be able to put into it,but would like to keep adding money obviously. Whats my best bet since i have about 40+ years until i would hopefully need it.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> With $2000 you have just enough to begin investing.  Most mutual funds require that you have a minimum of at least $2000, some are more, some are less. <br>
 <br>
Since your time horizon is so long your best bet is probably the stock market.  In the short term (0-5 years) the market will fluctuate, up or down.  However over the long haul stocks tend to outperform everything else, and since the market is downish right now, you are in a good position to start. <br>
 <br>
I would open an IRA (individual retirement account) with a mutual fund company.  An IRA allows you to save money tax-deferred until retirement.  This is a huge bonus as your money will go a lot further when you don&#039;t have to pay taxes on your gains. <br>
 <br>
There are 2 basic types of IRAs.  A ROTH IRA and a &quot;Traditional IRA&quot;. <br>
 <br>
The ROTH IRA allows you to contribute up to about $5000 per year.  These contributions and their gains will never be taxable again.  However if you make an early withdrawal (before age 59 1/2) you will have to pay the taxes as well as a 10% IRS penalty, so make sure that this money is retirement money only!! <br>
 <br>
There are a few exceptions where you can withdraw early without penalty such as buying your first home, and paying for certain disability or medical expenses (talk to an accountant about this) but I would recommend avoiding early withdrawals at all cost. <br>
 <br>
The Traditional IRA works similarly however your contributions are tax deductible in the year that you contribute them.  This can theoretically allow you to contribute more to your account.  However when you withdraw the money you will have to pay taxes.  That&#039;s a bummer.  Also you will still have to pay the 10% penalty if you try to withdraw money before 59 1/2. <br>
 <br>
I would recommend a ROTH IRA for most young people as their incomes are typically a bit lower right now and taking the tax deduction now would probably be less effective than the money you will save later on. <br>
 <br>
Go to Vanguard***, call their sales reps, and ask them to open a ROTH IRA in your name.  A good mutual fund to start with is their total stock market mutual fund.  It is very low expense and will help you get started.  Try to make consistent monthly contributions of $25-$100 or more if you can afford it. <br>
 <br>
Eventually once you have grown your account balance to more than $50,000 you may want to hire a professional investment advisor.  Be sure to shop around though, some advisors are great and will help you invest more efficiently, others will overcharge you and will lose substantial amounts of your money. <br>
 <br>
Good luck!

The best long-term investment is to buy the stock SPY.  That is the symbol for the S&amp;P Depository Receipts.  That&#039;s just fancy language for the S&amp;P500 Index, which represents 500 of America&#039;s best corporations including Microsoft and the baby Berkshire Hathaway owned by Warren Buffet.  500 corporations means that by owning SPY you would be fully diversified. You would own computers, railroads, banks, drugs, retail, manufacturing, airlines, everything.   For the last 30 years, the S&amp;P500 Index (or SPY) has had an average annual return (dividends and market growth of over 10%.  Except for dumb luck in picking a manager like Peter Lynch or a stock like Microsoft when nobody had a computer, there is no other investment in the world that can match that record.  Research it.  You can get a calculator and run your own math, but if you start with $2000 and put in $160 per month, you will end up with about $1.3 million dollars at age 65.  If you let it ride and don&#039;t touch the principal, you could withdraw the 10% a year at age 65 and have over $10,000 a month to live on.  If you started taking some principal too that would be far more.  Sounds like a lot, but were talking 40 years from now. <br>
 <br>
To do this, you need to first have a brokerage account.  Once you do and have the $2,000 in a money market account at brokerage, call them and ask to set up a Roth IRA shell inside the brokerage account.  Move the $2,000 into that shell and start buying SPY.  Then set up an automatic withdrawal from checking to get your monthly contribution into the Roth IRA shell money market account.  You will then need to periodically buy SPY to keep the ball rolling. <br>
 <br>
Double check and confirm everything I said.  Specifically, you should try to find a managed mutual fund with a 30 year record of average annual return greater than 10%.  If you do find a few, the next thing to understand is that great manager will probably be dead or retired in a few years.
        </p> First thing I would do is open an online account with Fidelity or other good brokerage house. Mail them the $5K for deposit into your account. You will earn money market rates while it is in there. I would then buy a 1 year CD where you should be able to get a 5% rate. That will give you a whole year to learn more about what to do with your money and in that year, you will discover that things change so hasty decisions are usually not good ones. Some will recommend a Roth IRA, but I believe you want to get into common stocks as a buy and hold strategy. You have a long life ahead of you. Starting now to learn the ways of investing and saving will make you wealthy. A 5% firm return in hand is always better than a possible 10% return that goes south. Reach carefully to start with.
        </p> With your long term, I think a Roth IRA would be the best place to start.  You invest after tax money, but all of the earnings are tax free.   <br>
Mutual Funds are usually the safest since they are professionally managed. <br>
 <br>
Try looking up T Rowe Price in a Y! search.  They have a large assortment of funds. <br>
 <br>
This all applies only if you live and work in the US.
        </p> The US economy is in pretty bad shape and is completely laden with debt. You really can&#039;t count on it just going straight up in the future anymore. That makes traditional buy and hold investing dead as a doornail. I think the best thing to invest your money in these days is a strategy that can make money whether the market goes up or down.
