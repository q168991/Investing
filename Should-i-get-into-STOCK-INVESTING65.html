<h1>Should i get into STOCK INVESTING?</h1>
<div class="answer">im interested in additional ways to make money, besides working. (i know stock investing can be considered work) I currently don&amp;#39;t know the first thing about stock investing (except for buy low sell high). If i decide to get into it i would of course educate myself first by reading a book or two on the subject. any input would be appreciated. thanks :)<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> You would educate yourself by &quot;reading a book or two on the subject&quot;????  Would you diagnose yourself medically and perform surgery on yourself after &quot;reading a book or two on the subject&quot;? <br>
 <br>
Successful investing requires a knowledge about world events, accounting practices, tax consequences, law, psychology, and many other disciplines.  Markets react very quickly and you will quickly lose your money if you have not taken the steps to protect yourself in all types of markets.  Using margins and options will allow you to lose money that you don&#039;t have making it even more dangerous. <br>
 <br>
Most of the ways to make money, besides working, are illegal or risky.  Educate yourself in order to do a good job in whatever field you choose to work in.

        </p> So.. <br>
You should try with Penny Stocks Trading (you can find more info here: http://pennystocks.toptips.org ) <br>
 <br>
Penny stocks, also known as cent stocks in some countries, are common shares of small public companies that trade at low prices per share.  <br>
I&#039;ve been subscribing to this PennyStock web site for about a year now and have loved the objective advice they give. He really does look for quality stocks and I&#039;ve made some pretty nice profits on a lot of his suggestions. Being still fairly new to investing I have been dabbling a lot in penny stocks to try and grow my account. I may not have a big account, but it&#039;s a lot bigger than it was a year ago. On just one of Nathan&#039;s picks this year I managed to make my investment back ten-fold! Be careful! Penny stocks are notoriously risky but if you follow the right method the risk is almost 0. I suggest to invest only little money first and then reinvest the profits. This is the site I&#039;m using: http://pennystocks.toptips.org <br>
Bye Bye
        </p> hahahaha...you concede you MIGHT have to read a book or two. You want money without working for it. <br>
 <br>
Let us see...I worked at practicing trading for about 15 years before doing it for real and it is my only income for over 8 years now....did I get there reading a &quot;book or two&quot;....not bloody likely! <br>
 <br>
Should you get into stock investing??? Not with the attitude you show so far. It is far more difficult than you understand and reading a &quot;book or two&quot; won&#039;t help.
        </p> If you have some capital, it is actually good for you to invest in some blue chip stock. But it can be very expensive to get blue chips. If you want something less expensive you can try forex or options.  <br>
 <br>
However you need to have the skill, money and risk management.
        </p> There was a study done with monkeys, kindergardners and stock brokers. kindergardners picked the stocks they knew: Disney, toys&#039;r&#039;us, etc. Stock brokers did it their way. Ststistics, etc. And the monkeys picked stocks by throwing darts at a wall.. long story short.... stock brokers came in last. monkeys second, and kindergardners came in first... Pick stocks you know of and buy products from.
        </p> everyone should be into stock investing! <br>
 <br>
having realistic expectations is key. very few people get filthy rich in the market and the ones that do usually take years to get there. but you can grow your money if you&#039;re steady and methodical. <br>
 <br>
a good way to start is to open a large cap growth stock muual fund in an ira. dollar cost average into that to get your feet wet. from there it&#039;s wide open depending on how much reading/studying you want to do.
        </p> Stocks are for long-time investing, not making money over the short haul.  Investment in a mutual fund is a good start.  Charles Schwab is a good broker to use.
        </p> Yes, but I would suggest  mutual funds...
        </p> yes YOU SHOULD
