<h1>Is age 25 too late to start investing in retirement?</h1>
<div class="answer">I&amp;#39;ll be attending college starting this fall, and afterward I&amp;#39;ll probably join the Peace Corps. By the time I&amp;#39;m actually able to fully invest in retirement (into an IRA specifically) I figure I&amp;#39;ll be about 25. I will start in college but obviously I won&amp;#39;t be able to contribute anything substantial until I begin my career. I know that with investments like this its best to start earlier, so is age 25 too late to build up enough savings or will I be okay?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

What are you going to do, NOT start when you&#039;re able if someone says &quot;yeah, give it up if you don&#039;t have $15k put aside at 21&quot;?

</script><p> It&#039;s never too late but why can&#039;t you invest some now?   Every dollar invested now will be the equivalent of investing a lot more later.   You can even ask that any gifts be given to you as bonds or stocks that you can deposit to an IRA or brokerage account.   Saying that you can&#039;t start investing till you begin your career is a cope out and you know it.   As long as you have an income, you can and should divert a portion to your savings and investments.   If you wait till you feel secure, you may never start investing.
        </p> The younger you are when you start, the better your chances are you will receive the best overall benefit from time and the miracle of compounding. There are only three things you can count on when you start investing for your retirement future. No matter what age you begin, you will have to contend with risk, taxes and inflation.
        </p> If you start at 25 you will actually be way ahead of the average American. Sooner is always better when it comes to retirement investing but you will do very well if you start your contributions at 25.  <br>
 <br>
Check out this article on Compound Interest. I have a feeling it will give you confidence in your decsion to start at 25. <br>

        </p> It&#039;s never too late. It&#039;s just that the later you start the bigger a portion of your income you need to invest. I didn&#039;t start a 401K until I was past 40 but by investing the maximum allowed each and every year I was able to build up a decent nest egg for my wife and me. If it weren&#039;t for that 401K we&#039;d be in real trouble.
        </p> It&#039;s not too late. <br>
 <br>
Yesterday would have been better, but since we can&#039;t go back in time, TODAY is your next best option.- regardless of your age. <br>
 <br>
fyi.  in time, you will be want to contribute to your retirement plan at work b/c your contribution  limit in the IRA is only $5,000 (this year) and the 401k will allow for greater contribution. <br>
 <br>
Good for you to start now.
        </p> You need to start now! Most people never start and are affected by it when it comes time! This is important now more than ever because who knows what will be left of social security when we go to retire
        </p> No, it is not. I know people that did not start or even think about that until they were past 40 or even 50.  <br>
The future is now.
        </p> It is never too late. Actually I would say that is the age most people start.
        </p> No.  In fact, its rather early in the big scheme of things.  (most people don&#039;t start until they are close to 50)
