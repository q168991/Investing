<h1>I am going to begin investing in stocks, who should i open my account with?</h1>
<div class="answer">i have saved up extra cash about 2,500(which i know is not much but its what i can do) in order to begin investing in the stock market. i am very excited and have been studying for weeks now.  i know weeks isnt a long time but i like learning by truly experiencing. i have also been buying stocks on a simulator in which i have been ranked #1 for about a month now. i am very anxious and very eager to learn more. i am  prepared to completely lose all of my money but of course that is the last thing i want to do! i am looking to make a couple of trades a week and am curious of who would be the best company for me to open my account with without getting charged too many fees. i just want to get the best bang for my trading buck. please let me know about absolutely any knowledge you guys have on the subject if you are experienced. please do not reply if you are not experienced! advice on any books to read or what places to go and research more helpful advice on the subject would be great.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Forget being number one in any simulator.  The market can teach you a real lesson.  First go to your local bookstore and buy books on technical and fundamental analysis.  Then read them till you&#039;re done.  Start watching the market and stocks and last you can start trading when you feel comfortable.  Scottrade is a good place to open an account.  Low fees, no inactivity fees, many locations and only $500 to open an account.  With $2500 you can open a margin account which if managed properly can make your profits climb up twice as fast.  Good luck.

</script><p> Before you do start investing you should research what your money being put into. When you invest into a company that company obviously gains more control and becomes larger. Most corporations or large businesses are doing horrible things to people all over the world, the environment and animals. If you want to not be the cause of the problems in the world you should be strict as to where you put your money. Investing in stocks is not just about getting money out of it, it is a vote for what you want in the world. If you invest in oil, you invest in war, the oppression of other people and destruction of the planet. If you invest in wind power or renewable energy systems you will be helping that business get larger as is something that is happening more and more these days. Make sure you understand what the business does and what they put money into. Many corporations are connected to others therefore even though you are putting money into one company that you may feel is okay, local etc, they may be owned by a large company that is connected to things that you can see are damaging in ways. Do the same research on the place you open an account, of course, they are a corporation themselves. Just be careful and do your research.
        </p> Here&#039;s what I suggest you do: <br>
BEFORE opening any type of account - Investigate! <br>
 <br>
THIS is THE kind of account you should investigate opening: <br>
You want to have a &quot;speculating&quot;, &quot;speculator&quot; or &quot;speculative&quot; account. <br>
 <br>
You want &quot;margin&quot;. <br>
 <br>
You want to have the approval to trade &quot;Options - Calls and Puts&quot;. Options give you &quot;more bang for the buck&quot;.  <br>
 <br>
This type of account allows you to have the most flexibility with YOUR hard-earned money. <br>
 <br>
IF you open any other type of account, you are putting further restrictions on yourself and your trading flexibility. <br>
 <br>
THEN learn about options and how to trade them. <br>
 <br>
THEN paper trade, paper trade, paper trade, paper trade and paper trade some more. THEN paper trade some more. <br>
 <br>
You MUST have trading rules for each and every strategy you are interested in trading. When you have losing trades, you must re-adjust your trading rules. That is one of the main reasons why you paper trade. <br>
 <br>
THEN paper trade, paper trade, paper trade, paper trade and paper trade some more. THEN paper trade some more. <br>

        </p> Reliance Money was the first company in India to offer a flat <br>
fee structure for trading in stocks, commodities and other <br>
instruments, as against the industry practice of percentage brokerage charges per transaction. The industry brokerage fees averages around 0.5 per cent for delivery-based equity trades, which would result into up to Rs 2,500 for Rs five lakh of trading.
