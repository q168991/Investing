</script><p> If by short term you mean less than 5 years I would advise you to stay away from stocks and commodities, including gold.  Internet banks will have the highest rates on money market accounts and CDs.  You can check ***bankrate*** for current rates.   <br>
 <br>
To take a little more risk you could buy a bond mutual fund.  ***Morningstar*** will have some good recommendations on bond mutual funds.  Off the top of my head Loomis Sayles Bond Return - LSBRX is a great bond fund with decent returns. <br>

At least you should h have investment time focus for next three years. If your term is less than 3 year, I will never recommend a mutual fund path. <br>
 <br>
If you have 3 year time focus, select one of the fund from below ist, all are 5 start ranked and its performance is excellent. You can check this wordings with anybody as you like to know what is about the funds: <br>
 <br>
SBI Magnum Contra <br>
DSP Merry Lynch Tiger <br>
Sundaram Select Focus <br>
Kotak Opportunities <br>
ICICI Infrastructure <br>
SBI Magnum Equity <br>
 <br>
Select one have have invested for next 3 years. Care to select the monthly SIP method to have a disciplined investment approach. <br>
 <br>
You will certainly get good returns... sure <br>
 <br>
Best wishes.
        </p> Hi, if you are looking for a safe bet then you can go for bank but the returns are too low. Though mutual funds carry an element of risk, they give superior returns in long term say 8-10 years. <br>
http://***investorcamp.blogspot***
        </p> It&#039;s all about risks and returns....Since you need short term investment (it&#039;s not actually investment , it&#039;s called Speculation), i would suggest you to put them in mutual fund, which has comparatively higher return than banks.....Remember , risk is also higher in mutual fund..... <br>
 <br>
In any case, diversity your portfolio...Don&#039;t put all the eggs in one basket...Hope you get what i mean.
        </p> This money should be invested in a SIP(Systematic Invt Plan) of a good fund. You may choose <br>
 <br>
1. SBI Contra <br>
2. Tata Infrastructure <br>
3. HDFC Equity  <br>
 <br>
