 <br>
Value investing is the practice of buying a stock below it&#039;s &quot;intrinsic value&quot; in the hopes that it will eventually rise to that intrinsic value.  <br>
 <br>
The &quot;intrinsic value&quot; is what a value investor thinks the company is actually worth. For example, if a stock&#039;s price is currently $30, but a value investor, after having looked at it&#039;s financial statements, thought the stock is worth $50, then $30 would the the actual value and $50 would be the intrinsic value. <br>
 <br>
Value investing is a little tricky, in that there isn&#039;t any set-in-stone way to determine intrinsic value. It varies from person to person. <br>
 <br>
I wrote an article on value investing a little while back, you can check it out here if you&#039;re interested: <br>

 <br>
If you&#039;re interested in value investing and would like to research it more fully, Benjamin Graham wrote a book that I&#039;m told is one of, if not the best book out there on value investing. You can search Benjamin Graham on Amazon and it should come up with some good titles by him.  <br>
 <br>
Fun fact: Warren Buffet is a value investor, and is one of the wealthiest men on the planet!  <br>
 <br>
Hope this helps!
        </p> Buying companies at a discount to intrinsic value.  Intrinsic value may be measured by the present worth of a 10 year or more of a reliable income/profit/return stream.   The greater the discount the more attractive that company is.
        </p> That book is &quot;The Intelligent Investor&quot; by Benjamin Graham. It is the best book ever written on investing according to Warren Buffett and me.  I have read it several times.   <br>
