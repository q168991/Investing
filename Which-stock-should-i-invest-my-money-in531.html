</script><p> First, take 6 months in learning about stocks and trying it out with fake money in a stimulation web site like Yahoo! Finance. <br>
 <br>
***finance.yahoo*** <br>
 <br>
The stocks you want to focus on is consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and healthcare. These are DEFENSIVE stocks that will survive through good and bad times. Most of my positions are in these stocks. Some names include 3M, Procter &amp; Gamble, Kimberly Clark, Exxon Mobil, Walmart, Costco. Everybody&#039;s got to eat and wipe their butts regardless of the state of economy. Many of these companies survived through the Great Depression. <br>
 <br>
That&#039;s the benefits. You can sleep at night knowing your money is doing well. There are NO guarantees that you won&#039;t lose money. It&#039;s just that these stocks are the best. They pay good dividends too. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
If you&#039;re new to stocks, DON&#039;T DAY TRADE. You&#039;ll a rookie in a world of professionals. I tried day-trading with Citigroup and AIG when they were a little bit over $1. I had some luck at first, making about $30 a day but I was way over my head. My luck didn&#039;t last long and I had to rethink my strategy. <br>
 <br>
Besides you can&#039;t do much with $100 in the market. Day trading involves A LOT of commissions to the broker. With all the commissions deducted from each trade, you&#039;ll be lucky if you only lose half your money. <br>
 <br>
I would just day trade using Yahoo! Finance. Open a stimulation account, give yourself $100 worth of fake money and play it in the stimulation format. You&#039;ll see what I mean by losing money every easily. <br>
 <br>
Good luck.

</script><p> Nobody can predict what stocks will only go up in value, that&#039;s like being able to see the future. If people knew that, everyone would be a millionaire many times over! <br>
 <br>
The best thing to do if you want stocks is to is invest in an index fund. This means that the fund is diversified (it includes lots of different stocks), and it goes up and down at the same rate as the overall market. With your investments in index funds, you won&#039;t have to constantly worry about selling or buying different stocks, it is the least stressful way to invest in stocks.
        </p> There have been many stocks you could have made a fortune off of back in March.  However, now is not a time to go cherry picking.  The volatility is gone.  I&#039;d say go with the Dow Jones Wilshire 5000 mutual fund if you are doing general investing. <br>
 <br>
For a retirement account, look for Target Date mutual funds.  For example, the Schwab Target 2030 is a mutual fund for those looking to retire in 2030.
        </p> You should buy stocks in companies you know.  Do you have a favorite store that you think is doing well?
        </p> Big national companies like APPLE..I bought it at $101 and now its $160. go with be national companies. Also with companies that make batteries because car maker are going to start using battery power. FORD was at 5 dollar know its at 8 dollars.
        </p> You can look for myfxfunds in google/yahoo search engine <br>
My Managed Account has grown to 40% in 3 months. <br>
and this week my account has profit 5.3% <br>
By the way my capital is 100K  but you can start with minimum 2000 to test.
        </p> Why would you want to know that? Stock investing is about enriching brokers not investors. :)
        </p> I like General Electric (GE)  They pay a little dividend and are recovering nicely too.
        </p> look into spng. penny stock, but has a lot of potential
        </p> AIG
