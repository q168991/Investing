<h1>How do I choose what stocks to invest in?</h1>
<div class="answer">Honestly, I have no idea where to begin with this. I am young and feel that it would be beneficial to invest in stocks. Through the company I work for, we can choose investments. I am provided a list of the Average Annual Returns in 1yr, 3yr, 5 yr and 10 yr increments. As expected, these numbers fluctuate--some in the negative, some positive returns. What gives a good indication of a wise investment? I&amp;#39;m not neccessarily looking for quick or immediate returns in investment, but certainly don&amp;#39;t want to lose my money. I am prepared to lose some and gain some, knowing that the stock market fluctuates. What information, experience or helpful tips do you have to help me decide what to invest in. I have the option to invest different percentages up to 100% over these different options. I am also interested in the future, in investing in stocks outside of the company that I work for. I wouldn&amp;#39;t know where to start or how to choose! Thank you every one. Try to keep your suggestions easy to understand, I&amp;#39;m new to this!<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Start with an index fund. <br>
 <br>
Your company (your 401k?) probably provides a choice of mutual funds rather than individual stocks. A mutual fund is a group of stocks, so in theory the price should fluctuate less than each individual stock does. <br>
 <br>
Most mutual funds have a manager who picks which stocks the fund buys and sells. In addition to the Annual Returns you will also see an annual Expense Ratio - this is how much of your money goes to pay the manager&#039;s salary, transaction costs, and other expenses. Obviously you want to pick a fund with low expenses. <br>
 <br>
An index fund buys the stocks in, for example, the S&amp;P500 index. There is very little buying and selling, so the expense ratio is low.  <br>
Actively managed funds will sometimes have higher returns than index funds, but on average, in the long run, they do worse. High past returns are a good sign, but they don&#039;t guarantee a fund will do well in the future. Maybe it just got lucky. <br>
 <br>
You should also invest in bonds as well as stocks if that&#039;s an option. The rule of thumb that I&#039;ve heard is that you should invest (100 minus your age) % in stocks. Assuming this is a retirement account or other long-term investment - if you&#039;ll need the money within 10 years then play it safer.

</script><p> Now there is the right way to ask that question! Congratulations, you have taken the first correct step in investments. <br>
You should invest in companies that provide products and services that everybody seems to want.  In the long term, they will be more successful that then others. <br>
If everybody buys Nokia phones, invest in Nokia; if everybody likes Addidas shoes, then you should buy Addidas stock.  A company that comes up with the iPod, the iPhone and the iPad, after they already revolutionised the Personal Computer three or four times in the past is likely to do better than a fly-by-night outfit that has one success and nothing else. <br>
Of course, that only workd is you invest long-term (five or more years) - anything shorter than that becomes much more speculative and requires additional analysis.
        </p> Even before you make a call what and where to start investing, learn the investment rule by Warren Buffet. First rule is you must make $ and second remember the first rule. It is a not smart way to invest with win some and lose some principle.
