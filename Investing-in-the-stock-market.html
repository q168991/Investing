 <br>
here are the pointers: <br>
* Age more than 18 years <br>
* get PAN card <br>
* Address proof <br>
* Bank account of own name <br>
* Submit these &amp; required documents by brokers <br>
* Once account is open, you can simply place &quot;Buy&quot; or &quot;Sell&quot; orders for stocks. <br>
 <br>
Currently trading stocks in other countries is not possible, but you can trade foreign indexes as a form of ETFs. <br>
 <br>
anyways, trading or investing in stocks is very hectic. <br>
You can go for GOLD ETFs, Real Estate/ Land, etc.
        </p> Take some time to learn the basics and practice trading to see if you can make any profit before you start though as many beginners lose initially.  <br>
 <br>
A great way to learn the basics that you can do at times that suit you, is through virtual stock market trading where you can keep track of your trades and analyze them.  <br>
 <br>
The difference is that you trade as though it were real but any losses are only on paper.  <br>
 <br>
Keep practicing until you know you can make it work before risking real cash.  <br>
 <br>
Some of the best virtual stock trading providers even offer prizes in games and competitions to make the experience more interesting and fun.
        </p> Stock Market is good investment. You should invest in Stock Market. First of all open demat account
        </p> Yes, you need to open a brokerage account with a US broker. After you fund the account (put money in it) you can trade US stocks. <br>
Yes, you can trade Mcdonalds, it&#039;s symbol on the US market is MCD. <br>
Yes, you can trade Coca-Cola, it&#039;s symbol on the US market is KO. <br>
 <br>
If you are not investing a lot of money, choose a broker with low commission rates. I use the broker Realfasttrader*** they only charge $.39 per 100 shares traded.
        </p> Well quite a technical question you have asked. For authenticate answer, kindly post this query to the Facebook page of Mansukh. There, the experts will help you in a much better way. I m giving the link in source section.
        </p> Invest your money in Commodity market to gain huge profit.
        </p> You should invest in real estate
        </p> You need to have a Demat account.
