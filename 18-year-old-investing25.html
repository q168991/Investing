<h1>18 year old investing?</h1>
<div class="answer">Well I&amp;#39;m 17 now, almost 18 and a senior in high school. Today in my economics class we watched a video of Dave Ramsey or someone like that talk about investing and compound interest. This really got me thinking. I don&amp;#39;t want to be like some of the older people in my family that have to work past the age of 65, I want to have lots of money available to me when i retire. 

The problem is I don&amp;#39;t have a clue about investing or the right thing to invest in. I know the stock market is at a low right now so it could possibly be a good thing to look into, but I want something for the long run. Somethings that I&amp;#39;ll be able to make a killing in many years down the road. 

Can someone suggest a good way to invest. And how do you get involved in compound interest?

I don&amp;#39;t know if this will make a difference, but I have $3,000 currently in the bank, and I plan on joining the military and sticking with that many years.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> I think you want to invest fairly aggressively. I recommend putting the money in the Royce low price stock fund.  <br>
When you get to about 10,000 then it is time to really study asset allocation.  <br>
I have a few other URLs that my help you. You are very wise to learn. <br>
Best of luck to you!

</script><p> One type of investment that you are probably familiar with is the boring old bank account. Here you can get about 2.5% a year ($2.50 for every $100) for the money you have in your account. Not the best way to invest but an easy way to start. <br>
 <br>
Another type of investment is the certificate of deposit (CD). CD&#039;s are a type of lending investment. With a CD you lend your money to a bank for a specific time, say 6 months, and they give you your money back with an interest rate of 6 to 7 percent compounded onto that amount. CD&#039;s are a guaranteed safe investment. <br>
 <br>
Bonds are another type of lending investment similar to CD&#039;s. Bonds can be issued by a bank or company. Through the next four years you can earn 7 percent interest through a bond (Calculate that for a $100 investment and it comes out to about $130 after four years). <br>
 <br>
The best way to make your money grow is through the stock market. Historically the stock market has on average returned 11 percent annually. However, the stock market can be the most volatile place in which you can lose a lot of your money. You must realize that risk and return go hand-in-hand.
        </p> If your money is in the bank, it&#039;s probably already earning compound interest, albeit at a low rate. <br>
 <br>
Compound interest will help, but at best, in the end you have the same as you put in originally, because of inflation.  Let&#039;s say that a Big Mac meal is $5 today, and you put that $5 in the bank.  You leave it there, and it earns interest, so when you&#039;re old and gray like me, you have $100.  But at that time, $100 will be the price of a Big Mac meal.  But if you had put in $5 a month since your teens (and maybe more, when your salary went up) you&#039;d have a pile of money. <br>
 <br>
At your age, it would be appropriate to put most of your money into equities (stocks).  But don&#039;t be a gambler and try to pick individual stocks.  Buy shares in a low-cost mutual fund such as those from Vanguard.
        </p> I think &quot;A  Nobody&quot; gave you some sound advice that you should give careful consideration <br>
 <br>
Without having more information about your personal information, current income and other data such as risk tolerance, martial status, and demographics it would be very inappropriate for me or any other responsible person to provide specific investment information in this type of media.  <br>
And it would not be prudent for you to accept any specific investment advice from unknown individuals here at YA or a similar media. <br>
 <br>
Just be careful taking specific investment advise from people you have not met. <br>
 <br>
I too would like to thank you for thinking about serving your country, stay safe, and return safely so that you can invest you hard earned money well.
        </p> Based on over 40+ years in the securities industry, I submit the following for your consideration. <br>
 <br>
Before you enter into any transaction, you should know what you are doing, why you are doing it and how to do it.  <br>
Before you invest in any security, the first investment you should make is in yourself, and the best investment you can make is by educating yourself.  <br>
 <br>
Start your education by learning why you should invest and the importance of being able to make your own decisions or how the pro’s make theirs. <br>
