<h1>What can a 15 year old invest in to make money?</h1>

</script><p> At a young age, the best thing to invest in is your education.  Because your future income will depend a lot on how much education you have and how good your education is.   <br>
 <br>
I suggest that you save up your money to pay for college tuition and living expenses while you study.  <br>
 <br>
It&#039;s very hard to get something for nothing in the long run.  And for every investor who makes spectacular profits in the stock market there are a few who end up with spectacular losses.

</script><p> Right now is a great time to invest but you have to be careful. Invest in mutual funds or companies that are least likely to go bankrupt. I suggest: <br>
Bank of America (BAC) <br>
Citi Group (C) <br>
JP Morgan <br>
Microsoft <br>
Yahoo <br>
StarBucks <br>
 <br>
A little more risk with more return: <br>
DR Horton (DHI) <br>
Whole Foods (WFMI) <br>
 <br>
Invest 25% of the money you want to Invest right now. Invest another 25% in the begining of January, another 25% in the begining of March and another 25% in the begining of May. It will average out a good price. <br>
 <br>
Do not invest 100% of your saving, keep atleast 50% of your savings in a CD.
        </p> I wouldn&#039;t dare tell anyone exactly what to invest in, but the previous answers of &quot;your education&quot; are the best. Personally I would look for some cheap investment course somewhere like Ebay.  <br>
 <br>
Years ago, I started learning about commodities and if you&#039;re patient you can make good money trading them, however, if you treat it  as a get rich quick scheme, you will get burnt. <br>
 <br>
If you&#039;re interested, here is a link to some free starter information. <br>

 <br>
I don&#039;t make anything for introducing people, and like I said, I have been doing this for years and it will cost you nothing to look at it. <br>
 <br>
Good luck, you&#039;re on the right track already (you know that you need to do this for yourself, nobody else cares about your money like you do, so don&#039;t entrust it to them, learn and trade on your own behalf) <br>
 <br>
And remember, if it ain&#039;t fun, it&#039;s just the same as any other job, so find something you enjoy doing.
        </p> A 14-year old is much too young getting into investment. Collecting baseball card may weell be the option. Physically, you are 14 and 6&#039;5&quot;. You are a tall big boy and still growing. Why not concentrate in a sport that requires your height, such as basketball. When you are 18, 7&quot; tall, 1 year in a NCAA college and play good. You could be drafted in the NBA and could become an instant millionair.
        </p> hey go to the page imma leave for u its a 6 dollar investment that will make u money in the near by future its an opportunity for a young person to c a good income in a few weeks and u wont have to buy or sell or trade anything and u will b ok also if u r  in 2 stocks invest in video game companies and toy comapnies and a mutual founds but FIRST go to  the page im leaving and u will be the judge for only a 6 dollar investment to keep gud for stock bonds and a futher education <br>

        </p> That depends on how much money you have.   The best thing to do is invest in your education.    So save your money for college and learn a marketable skill.
        </p> Investing in the right penny stocks is one of the most lucrative ways to make money in the stock market. Learn here https://tr.im/7T2GQ <br>
 <br>
Tiny companies are a great way to make a fortune off of the stock market. Every trading day one thing’s almost certain: the biggest gaining stocks are bound to be penny stocks. The profit potential of penny stocks has been turning heads for some time now.
        </p> You can make good money like me with this binary option signal software ( http://forexsignal.kyma.info ) Binary options trading has always been popular, however, this investment fad globally exploded around 2008. Originally known as digital options, binary or the name &quot;two values&quot; was added to give a simpler explanation for trading options. Binary is defined as two values or up and down movements. Binaries rely on underlying assets or derivatives. You can trade in commodities, the forex (foreign exchange market), commodities as well as stock indices.

         invest in a money market fund
        </p> I was just about to suggest to put your money into a saving account.  <br>
 <br>
ICICI is offering 5.75 (you cannot move your money for a year though) <br>
 <br>
Otherwise, the post office is offering a nice 5.25% and your interests are paid monthly. But the issue is...you need to be 16 at least. <br>
