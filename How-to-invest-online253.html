<h1>How to invest online?</h1>
<div class="answer">I have around $7,000-$9000 and i really want my money to grow instead of just sitting at home. I have thought about putting the money in the bank but the interest is not worth it. I want to learn how to invest online. I have no idea about investing. Can someone please help me. If you invest online do you have to pay a broker fee? How do you pick your stocks? whats the best investing site? Is there a fee? Please help me, i need the basics. Thanks<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> If you don&#039;t know anything about investing it would be best to invest in mutual funds instead of individual stocks.  There are always fees but you can use brokers like Sharebuilder***, Vanguard*** or etrade***.  Sharebuilder and Vanguard are both companies I use.  These sites have sections where you can compare funds. <br>
 <br>
If you are just looking for something safe that will keep it at/above inflation you can look at money market funds, preferrably with FDIC (Federal Insurance in case of bankruptcy) such as GMACbank*** which currently has a rate of 3.5% <br>
 <br>
Your local bank as well as online banks have Certificate of Deposits that often have higher rates than savings but have time limits (6 months, 9 months, 1 yr, 2 yr, etc) <br>
 <br>
It may be worthwhile to get a consult from a professional if you plan on investing continually.

</script><p> The safety of your money (and its potential return) depends on what you invest in. Basically, the safest places to put your money would be government-backed bonds (T-Bills, for example) or a bank&#039;s money market account. Barring a total collapse of the federal government, these are pretty much safe. You should look for an APY (annual percentage yield) of 4% or more in this case. Stocks offer a higher potential return but more risk. It is entirely possible (though perhaps not likely) to lose a significant portion of your investment. The best way to guard against the risk of losing money is to diversify into many different holdings, although this is difficult with only $100. I would also say that the broad American stock market is not poised to return much at the moment, so you may wish to stay out of this area. Another area that is receiving a lot of attention is the commodities sector. Commodities can be just about any raw material, but the commodities with the most attention now are probably oil, natural gas, and gold. While it has previously been difficult to invest in these, the advent of ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) allow you to trade certain commodities just like stocks. You can invest in gold under the ticker symbol GLD and oil under the ticker symbol USO. I think that this area (and bonds) are probably the best areas to invest in over the next few years. Keep in mind that if you invest online, the fees are likely to be an incredibly high percentage of your initial investment. The least expensive online stock brokers charge around $4 to $7 per trade, which means that fees will make up a higher percentage of your initial investment if it is low ($100) than if it&#039;s higher ($1,000 to $10,000 or more).
        </p> I had the same problem as you have. <br>
I had a good amount of money, but didn&#039;t knew where to invest it. <br>
So I looked around for something that gave me a great return towards a low risk. <br>
And the only thing I could find was a mannaged account. <br>
Here you can follow up my results of every day: <br>

        </p> Have you though about offshore bank accounts? <br>
Or sticking it in a normal bank overseas? <br>
For example in Us or Uk bank interest is really low and places like Turkey they offer 20% interest. <br>
Or premium bonds? <br>
With stocks and shares its hit and miss, you can loose a lot of money, you want the money to grow not loose any of it.
