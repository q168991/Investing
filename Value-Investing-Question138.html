<h1>Value Investing Question?</h1>
<div class="answer">I know that you value investors love bear markets because they can buy great companies &amp;quot;on sale&amp;quot;...after all who doesn&amp;#39;t enjoy a bargain. I&amp;#39;m having trouble with the math equations and what to look for on financial statements. I use Reuters*** to look up financials... What do I look for and what kind of numbers make a company a value investing candidate?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> I suggest you start reading about economy and finances etc. So you get an idea about emerging/existing themes etc. to give you a better sense of how to define &#039;value&#039; <br>
 <br>
Try picking such stocks in next bear run. <br>
Low hanging fruits are mostly gone this time. <br>

</script><p> Wal Mart didn&#039;t fall because it&#039;s a defensive stock.  During troubled times WMT and MCD will out perform because they&#039;re cheap, and when you got no money you tend to go to Walmart instead of a luxury store.   <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Value investing uses common sense, but you need to know your way around an annual report.  You can get annual reports free.  .  Very interesting to read.  There are some good books about reading annual reports.  Peter Lynch: One up on wall street, Morning star, 7 common mistakes in the stock markets, and there is  Dummies guide to reading annual reports as well that is  a very helpful read.   <br>
 <br>
Bottom line, if you&#039;re going to be a value investor, you need to get very familiar with annual reports, and quarterly reports.  Edgar online has all the SEC filings for free.
        </p> Best not for you to make that distinction.  Value and growth, small cap and large cap, risk category are all applied to stocks by the experts.  You will find any stock so classified by looking on financial sites.  Bear markets can provide a value buying opportunity but not much. Check out Walmart from September 2007 to today.  The whole world fell in a hole, but Walmart just kept plugging along.  Even value investors would think large cap growth stocks in cases like this.
        </p> couple of financial ratio when you screen the stock to find a value in the company: <br>
 <br>
p/e ( price /earrning ratio) == 15 or less <br>
PEG ratio == 1 or less <br>
P/S (price/sale)== 1 or less <br>
P/B (price/book )==1 or less. <br>
Positive Dividend , so the dividend should be &gt;0 <br>
Positive Earning <br>
Increase in cash flow from year to year. If the company depleted its cash flow in a short period of time. Like Enron, you should sell/exit your position. <br>
 <br>
You heard the last decade was the worst decade since the great depression. It is actually working out pretty good for me. <br>
I start work in the end of 1997 when I was 25. I am eligible contribute to to my 401k is june/1998. I save 10% of my salary for 5 years, the last 6 years , I save 15%. So as December 31, 2009. My 401k is 100k, my Roth IRA is 21500.00. and My cash on hand is 30000.00. No debt except my mortgage. <br>
 <br>
I use the value investment mentality to screen my investment. I sell it when it become expensive. <br>
 <br>
You should learn 4 steps to market work: <br>
