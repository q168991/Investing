</script><p> For now, pick the appropriate target date fund because it will provide automatic diversification.  When you have accumulated $10,000+ in your account, you can consider investing in additional mutual funds there.  In the meantime, get yourself a copy of &quot;Mutual Funds For Dummies&quot; - it&#039;s an excellent book that will enable you to make sense of all those choices.

</script><p> You should hire an investment advisor to help you with this.  Most people in your position would go with a stock fund because you don&#039;t need to access your money for a very long time.  Stocks will fluctuate violently in the short run, but tend to produce the best returns over the long haul.  20 years should be plenty of time. <br>
 <br>
PIMCO total return is a bond fund.  This is an alternative to stocks.  Bonds pay interest, fluctuate less in price, and tend to earn lower returns over the long run.  More conservative investors generally like bonds. <br>
 <br>
The retirement funds (retirement 2010 for example) are a mix of stocks and bonds.  Dates further out have more stocks/less bonds.  As the retirement date approaches, the fund changes to hold more bonds.  It&#039;s a decent theory because most people like to be more defensive as they get older, however by automatically timing your market exit you can switch out at the wrong time. <br>
 <br>
Again, you should talk to an advisor about this.  Nobody on yahoo answers would be qualified to help you, especially without getting more information about you and your financial situation.  With a 401k you assume all of the investment risk, unlike with a pension where your company guarantees you a payout and assumes the investment risk themselves.  If you feel uncomfortable picking your own investments, pay an investment advisor who charges an hourly fee to help you understand.
        </p> One solid self sufficient source for mutual fund information is Morningstar. pattern link for considered one of your options below. ACRNX is the ticker image for the Acorn fund, this is the nicely-known shorthand thank you to look up information on a fund. you haven&#039;t any longer have been given many judgements, yet do have some solid ones. right this is one obtainable allocation utilising the money with extra useful music archives. 30% Pimco comprehensive return (PTTPX) 20% Acorn international 30% forefront 500 20% forefront Small Cap advance Pimco comprehensive return is a bond fund, yet in all probability the main suitable interior the investment industry. in spite of a extreme danger tolerance, diversification is a solid concept. Acorn international invests in medium length shares exterior the U. S.. which will provide you exposure to diverse agencies, international places, and currencies. the only different non-US fund is Artio, which i do in comparison to as plenty. forefront 500 is an index fund designed to verify the return of the S&amp;P 500 index at very low fee. this would nicely be a bypass-component of the main important US agencies. forefront Small Cap advance invests in smaller, quicker-turning out to be US agencies. 20% is a reasonably aggressive allocation, yet in preserving which includes your age and danger tolerance.
        </p> The only one I would avoid, is ...ARTIO INTL.,..All the rest are respectably in the Ball Park. <br>
Considering we&#039;ve had a 2 year bull market run, your first year starting, ...now... would probably be negative returns...If it were me and the option was available, and your company stock was..Safe..I&#039;d take the match for company stock, and wait till the market took a major correction to switch into your equity stock choices.
