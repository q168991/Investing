<h1>Investing in the stock market.....?</h1>
<div class="answer">I have about $1000 in which I could invest in the stock market IF I an find the correct company/portfolio in which to invest. I&amp;#39;m 24 &amp; I&amp;#39;ve never been involved in investing before. I don&amp;#39;t &amp;quot;need&amp;quot; the money or need to earn &amp;quot;quick returns&amp;quot; although like everyone if I did I sure wouldn&amp;#39;t complain. 

How should I go about finding the best companies to buy stock in right now. Since AIG, Frannie &amp; Freedy, the banks &amp; auto industries are all gaining so much support from the government would these companies/industries be good places to start? They have rather low prices per share &amp; the government is bailing them out so that they don&amp;#39;t go bankrupt. 

If you have any advice please pass it my way. I&amp;#39;m planning on doing a LOT of research prior to doing ANY investing. Thanks!<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> I used to be where you are about 9 months ago. I still consider myself a beginner. <br>
Before you go buy shares with real money. I&#039;d suggest you do something different (there&#039;s always opportunities to make money, even if the money goes up or down). <br>
First get informed. Read books, watch cnbc(jim cramer, and fast money are good shows for just learning terms, and theory), follow the market. Learn, and absorb as much as possible. The more informed you are, the better trader you will be. <br>
Next find a good virtual trader (this allows you to trade stocks like you were with real money, if you fail.. no biggie it&#039;s fake money). This allows you to really understand how the market moves, and allows you to test out your theories in trading. If i had to do it all over again, i&#039;d probably trade with optionsxpress. It has a nice virtual trader, and great features, also no inactivity fee&#039;s, etc. I currently trade with scott trade, but they don&#039;t offer all the trading types I want to, so i&#039;m going to move my account to optionsxpress. <br>
 <br>
Some of the books that helped me were these: <br>
http://***amazon***/Mastering-Trade-Mc... <br>
http://***amazon***/Technical-Analysis... <br>
http://***amazon***/Trading-Zone-Confi... <br>
Jim Cramer books are excellent too. <br>
 <br>
I would avoid finacials at all cost. They is just too much volatility. I&#039;d suggest buying a consumer products company, something that traded laterally (or in a channel for TA people). Something like coke, pepsi, johnson and johnson, it&#039;s a safer bet for a beginner like yourself. <br>
 <br>
Hope this helps alot <br>
I also learned alot from this <br>

</script><p> I wouldn&#039;t jump right in to it. Research the issues first and be certain that any money invested is money that you can afford to lose. Remember, all investments in the market are not winners. Some lose big time. First hand, you should have 3-6 months of funds available in an accessible account for emergency funds. Don&#039;t ever go without this if you&#039;re going to invest in the market as that rainy day could be just around the corner. Literature from brokerage houses or the NYSE could be a place to start learning.

Hold onto your money.  The stock market is not <br>
conducive to getting positive returns to a new-comer, <br>
in the cu rent environment, and it is likely that the <br>
market will be in decline for years to come. <br>
 <br>
You have time on your side, so use it wisely. <br>
Spend about $15 and by &quot;How To Invest In Stocks,&quot; <br>
by William O&#039;Neil.  You will learn about selecting <br>
stocks that are likely to outperform the market, <br>
consistently. <br>
 <br>
There is also a companion web site: <br>
 <br>
http://beta.investors*** <br>
 <br>
but do not skip the book. <br>
 <br>
You may also want to look into putting some <br>
of your funds into gold and silver coins.  During <br>
times of economic uncertainty, both hold their <br>
value much better that paper asset alternatives. <br>
[Currency and stocks are paper assests.] <br>
 <br>
There are a slew of books you can read, but for <br>
a beginner, first impressions are important, so <br>
O&#039;Neil is a great start. <br>
 <br>
You will learn to be in charge of your own financial <br>
destiny, and that is empowering.
        </p> If I were you, I will rent or subscribe newsletter stock and plan to use my profit to buy the stock robot. The problem is the price will burn my pocket. It is $112,000.(1 year licence). I only can rent it. <br>
 <br>
But the power is undeniable and at the moment I only can subscribe it, and make some money. This is the best deal (but not for get rich overnight); you can make  $100 day or $ 200 per day with small investment.
        </p> If a company needs a bailout does that sound like a company to invest your hard earned dollars in? You want a company that can survive well on its own. Find comapnies being ignored by investors and that are going to come out with a product or service that will blow everyone away.
        </p> If you just want to put it in and leave it try an index fund which reflects the total market. If things go up you will see gains. A lot of people recommend Vanguard Funds as they don&#039;t rip you off on fees like most mutual fund companies do.
        </p> Citi stock
        </p> If you want a good online stock broker I would recommend Scottrade. You can visit them at http://***scottrade***/. Enter this code: UDUA2252 in their referral program and receive 3 free trades. <br>
 <br>
Remember to always do your homework before purchasing any investment. <br>
 <br>
Happy trading!
        </p> You&#039;re better off putting your money in a CD and letting interest build up. Stock market is STILL going down.
        </p> I started with $1000 just this past February and I&#039;m close to tripling it as of this posting. <br>
 <br>
Now that I said that, I&#039;m sure I&#039;m going to catch hell, so let me say this:  this is just a personal opinion, not a qualified one you&#039;d get from a financial advisor or from chartered financial analysts.  Investing in the market is much more stressful than putting up with a bipolar boss who&#039;s keenly aware of the job market and your past mistakes that made him look bad (not that I have a bipolar boss and I hope no one does, but I digress).  Investing is a lifestyle--there are no short cuts--you have to put in the effort and the time. <br>
 <br>
If you really want to cut through all of this, go to number four and number five.  That should answer your questions. <br>
 <br>
So this is where I would start: <br>
 <br>
1.  Start learning about the different methods of investing. <br>
--You start by determining your risk exposure.  Is exposing $1000 to risk acceptable?  (i.e. Can you accept losing $1000 after you&#039;ve made a bad decision?  Is looking at a particular stock&#039;s rise good enough for you to make that decision?  You may want rethink that if you said yes.) <br>
 <br>
2.  Research the different investment vehicles available to you. <br>
--Bankrate*** can provide you with the most competitive CD rates from different banks out there.  I know you asked for info on stocks, but you have to put your capital gains somewhere after you&#039;ve made money in your investments. <br>
--Mutual Funds are another great resource to invest in.  Vanguard, Fidelity, and other institutions will gladly send you a prospectus of their funds.  This is also another place to store your capital gains, and potentially provide a better option than CDs since the potential returns may be higher, especially if the fund you choose is a no-load fund.  The flipside of the coin, however, is that the fund is also susceptible to market down turns.  The fluctuation may not approach stock price fluctuations in the stock market, but it is still a loss. <br>
--Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) are like mutual funds traded on the market.  Their potential returns are much higher, and yes, the flipside of the coin applies here to.  The bright side of ETFs compared to Mutual Funds is that the only commission you&#039;ll pay for an ETF is the commission from the brokerage firm you&#039;re using to buy the ETF, vice fees from an institutional Mutual Fund.  This is another place you may want to consider placing your capital gains. <br>
 <br>
3.  Brokerages are your tools for trading. <br>
--E-Trade, TD Ameritrade, Thinkorswim***, Sharebuilder, and other brokerage firms are available.  These are online brokerages where you can trade anywhere as long as you have an internet connection.  They also have other options available such as broker assisted trades for an added premium. <br>
--Each brokerage has it&#039;s own advantages that separates it from the others, so choose wisely.  Personally, customer service is very important to me, especially when my money is at stake.  Other things to consider are the brokerage fee schedules (do they charge for you whenever you trade, or do they also charge you if you&#039;re not active?) <br>
--Be sure to read the fine print about their offers.  &quot;100 Free Trades&quot; could mean that you have to trade 100 times in a certain period before the brokerage gives you the &quot;free&quot; offer.  In other words, you still have to pay for each trade (some as much as $7.99 or more per trade!) and when you reach the magic number 100, THEN they&#039;ll credit the offer to your account (you won&#039;t be charged for those 100 trades).  Undeniably tempting upon a cursory glance, until you read the fine print. <br>
--When you set up an account with them, be prepared!  You will go through a process as if you&#039;re being interrogated.  Have your funding source information ready (i.e., the bank that your $1000 is deposited can be transferred electronically to the brokerage), and your personal information.  If you will set up an IRA-type account with that brokerage, you may have to divulge information as to where you will send your money if the unthinkable happens. <br>
 <br>
4.  Research, Research, Research, and Paper Trade. <br>
--DO THIS BEFORE BUYING INTO ANY STOCK, MUTUAL FUND, OR ETF.  Trust me on this one, as this is where the &quot;lifestyle&quot; part of my opinion is based. <br>
--Why?  Because it will not do you any good to blindly navigate through the myriad of choices available. <br>
--The Motley Fool, Investor&#039;s Business Daily, and ETF Guide are a few of the multitude of choices available.  They have proprietary stock and ETF screens that they do charge in order for you to access them, but I personally think it&#039;s worth it (the returns from my portfolio based on the stock screens just from the Motley Fool and Investor&#039;s Business Daily helped pay for their subscription rates alone).  These sites also have education areas for new investors--FREE.   <br>
--You can apply what you&#039;ve learned from those educational sites by going to any of the free stock screening sites such as msn***&#039;s &quot;Money&quot; in their investment section (http://moneycentral.msn***/investor/research/welcome.asp).  Or you can even use Google&#039;s stock screen in their financial section. <br>
--Paper trade.  YOU MUST DO THIS so that you can gain discipline and be able to differentiate the empty-hype from the true performers.  There are other sites or applications that allow you to paper trade, such as tradery*** and clearstation***, or  thinkorswim&#039;s &quot;Papermoney&quot; allow you to practice trading and to get used to the chaotic environment.  Wallstreet Survivor is game-based but it still serves its purpose.  Now, you&#039;ll start off with an inflated account of $100,000 or more, so it is easy for you to lose track of the seriousness of practicing for the real thing.  I kept my focus by keeping in mind that the practice money in the paper trade could be mine one day, and how I perform with that kind of money can easily reflect my discipline with just $1000 to invest with in real life. <br>
--Another note about paper trading:  TEST THE STOCK RECOMMENDATIONS from the sites mentioned.  The paper trade sites and applications may also come with research tools, some with backtesting functions that can help validate the recommendation.  I NEVER BUY or SHORT BASED ON AN OUTRIGHT RECOMMENDATION UNLESS I INVESTIGATE IT FIRST. <br>
--Read books on investing.  They offer the different schools of thought and investing techniques.  The Motley Fool&#039;s, &quot;Million Dollar Portfolio&quot;; John F. Carters, &quot;Mastering the Trade&quot;; the fourth edition of &quot;The Handbook of Personal Wealth Management&quot;; and Investor&#039;s Business Daily&#039;s, &quot;How to Make Money in Stocks&quot; by William J. O&#039;Neil are all excellent books.  &quot;How to Make Money in Stocks&quot; is my basic primer, as they provide quantifiable data that can be easily referenced. <br>
 <br>
5.  Since you asked about which stocks to go with, stay away from financials unless you&#039;re brave enough and armed with the right information to do it.  Until I see the right kind of volume and other indicators supporting the latest price increases, I am not buying into them just yet. <br>
--SOME of the best performing stocks AS OF THIS WRITING in my portfolio:  Starent Networks Corportation (STAR), Neutral Tandem Inc (TNDM), American Public Education INC (APEI), Netflix (NFLX), and Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD).  Each of them have very strong fundamentals, strong earnings per share, good relative strength, are owned by their management (their leadership buys their stocks which means that they&#039;re betting the stock WILL go up), have good pre-tax profit margins, and generally are in a good position to invest in for now.  The Motley Fool and Investor&#039;s Business Daily have identified Buffalo Wild Wings (BWLD) and some others in my portfolio (not listed here) as one of their top rated stocks among the thousands available. <br>
--ONE of the ETFs I own that form the basis for my core investments is iShares MSCI Emerging Markets (EEM).  I had bet that the ETF would retain its endurance in this turbulent market, and indeed this paid off especially in Monday. <br>
--I might consider transferring my capital gains from the liquidated shares to GMAC instead of my current bank thanks to Bankrate***.  The High Yield Rates for GMAC&#039;s 3 yr CD is currently 3.20%, which is better than my current bank&#039;s rate. <br>
 <br>
6.  Shoot for the stars.  I&#039;ll paraphrase a quote from the The Motley Fool: you can lose 100% of your investment, but there&#039;s no limit as to how high your investment can go if it&#039;s the right one.  If you&#039;ve managed to read this far, I thank you for doing so.  Don&#039;t ever get discouraged, don&#039;t EVER rush into a trading decision, and I&#039;ll see you in the virtual trading rooms out there one stock at a time.  Good Luck! <br>
 <br>
By the way, I hope my post reinforces everyone&#039;s post prior to mine.  They&#039;ve all made excellent recommendations, but since I&#039;m only a level 1, I can&#039;t rate them.  Kudos to them.
