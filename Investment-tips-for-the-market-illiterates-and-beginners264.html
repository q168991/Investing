<h1>Investment tips for the market-illiterates and beginners?</h1>
<div class="answer">I have never ever invested in mutual funds or stock markets. However, I recently played this game called predictopus in yahoo cricket (during cricket world cup) and finished at rank 34 after very quickly rising in rank (I started during the mid-group stages). Does that count at all? Can you guys suggest some beginner&amp;#39;s guide to investing online, buying selling shares. I feel that the fact that I do not know much about the companies/firms as well as I know the cricket teams is one important thing to note. I recently found this site https://***moneysights***/ and going through it. Any help would be appreciated. I would like to invest some Rs. 10,000 in low risk and another 10,000 in medium to high risk (short term). Any help/tips/links would be appreciated.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>
