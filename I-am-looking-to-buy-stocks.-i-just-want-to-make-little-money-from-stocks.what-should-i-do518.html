</script><p> If I understand you correctly, you want to invest in stocks for a short period of time and be guaranteed to make money to pay an upcoming bill. <br>
 <br>
Ain&#039;t gonna happen.  The stock market doesn&#039;t work like that.  Are you OK if your stocks lose money instead of make money?  If not, then you should not look at stocks.   <br>
 <br>
Instead you should look at a high interest online savings account like Emigrant Direct.  They&#039;re currently paying 5.15% APY guaranteed!  If you have a time horizon of more than a few months, but less than a year, then maybe a CD would be better. <br>
 <br>
If you want to RISK your money in the stock market, but do not know anything about individual stocks, then you should buy an exchange traded fund like (stock symbol) SPY, which essentially is buying part of the S&amp;P 500 index.  It&#039;s a good way to buy into the overall market without betting on individual stocks.

Best Wishes &amp;&amp; Good Luck!
        </p> What is your bill? <br>
If credit cards, take that money you would invest and pay it off, unless you can stand the greater risk and reward of stocks. <br>
What is your deadline? <br>
Usually bills are not going to ait around for you to pay them. Sharebuilder is probably the best if you have time but no inclination to pick stocks. <br>
Otherwise, play online poker. <br>
 <br>
Good luck!
        </p> If you were told to jump off a bridge,would you? First decide if buying any stock is appropriate for your circumstances.
        </p> well if you buy stock always sell on on the day before it close&#039;s so the war won&#039;t damage you if anything happens
        </p> u just open an account with share broking companies like sharekhan and india bulls. n u can buy and sell the shares through shares agent. n  u earn huge money
        </p> How much do you want to invest and how long do you want to wait for your $700.00? <br>
 <br>
For example, if you invest $7,000.00 USD at 10% you will get $700.00 USD after a year.
        </p> read tips and articles on investing and stocks that will help on this site
        </p> if you&#039;re looking to make little money, you should invest in like... cash. <br>
