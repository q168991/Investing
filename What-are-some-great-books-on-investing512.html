<h1>What are some great books on investing?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am a beginner to investment and trade with a attitude for learning the most I can before making any decisions. I just finished my &amp;quot;Investing for Dummies&amp;quot; as well as &amp;quot;Trading for Dummies&amp;quot;. I have a basic concept of both investing and trading and want to go deeper. Any good suggestions on how to approach? Thank you in advance.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> &quot;Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets&quot; for a general understanding of the basics of technical analysis. <br>
 <br>
&quot;Elliott Wave Principle&quot; gives an in depth understanding of how the markets work. <br>
 <br>
&quot;The Delta Phenomenon&quot; is for learning about the markets time cycles and when to buy or sell. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Reading to learn about it is important but the best way to learn though is to practice trading in a virtual account first to get hands on experience with zero risk.

</script><p> First you&#039;ve got to get your head straight before you invest a nickle in the market. Most investors do it just the opposite. Lose all their money, then figure I might want to get my head straight. Mark Douglas &quot;The Disciplined Trader&quot; is the absolute best book I have ever read about Psychology. Next, you need to learn stock picking skills. I would suggest &quot;Invest Like a Shark&quot; One of the best books out there on how the stock market REALLY works. Good luck and good trading!
        </p> The following are some of my favorite books on investing that I have found to be the most useful....good luck.  <br>
 <br>
Juggling Dynamite by Danielle Park [market cycles and sales side bias] <br>
Invest like a Shark by James Deporre [Importance of learning to &quot;sell&quot; to the small investor] <br>
Trend Following  by Michael Covel [Study of the Investment strategy of Trend Following] <br>
Technical Analysis for the Rest of Us by Clifford Pistolese [Basic Chart Reading] <br>
Sun Tzu&#039;s Art of War for Traders and Investors by Dean Lundell [Applying the timeless lessons of the ancient Chinese military general, strategist and philosopher... Sun Tzu to Trading and Investing]
        </p> There are several books and it depends upon you that from which book you can get the most benefit. I think that &quot;intelligent Investment&quot; is really a nice book and it can help you to know much more information than other books. Also, I would suggest you to search for some good e-books on investment.
        </p> Random Walk Down Wall Street <br>
Liar&#039;s Poker <br>
Barbarians at the Gates
        </p> Once your know the basics... <br>
I prefer reading the news about stocks , current articles, analysists opinions, motley fool, street*** and the stocks reports. You have to have a feel for the market that a book doesn&#039;t give you. Droughts in columbia, Spanish banks, economy in China, etc...
