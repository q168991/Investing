</script><p> hi <br>
my advice for u is,  dont invest in insurance, it wont give u any return . u will get more return from a fixed deposit scheme with 8% .  <br>
here in jeevan saral  <br>
for eg- suppose ur investing 1 lakh/ annum. and u have to continue the plan minimum for 3 years <br>
first year- premiumt-  amount- 1 lakh <br>
               agent commision0 25% <br>
               so net investment amount- 75000 <br>
second year- premium amount - 1 lakh <br>
                   agent commision - 7%= 7000 <br>
                  so net investment - 93000 <br>
third year-  premium - 1 lakh <br>
                agent commision = 5%= 5000 <br>
                net invested amount - 95000 <br>
 here for first 3 years <br>
toal premium paid= 3 lakh <br>
net investment or unit= 75000+ 93000+ 95000= 26300 <br>
ur agent made a profit of 35000 <br>
and ur net investment is giving nearly 10% growth ur, net position will be = 306000 <br>
ur profit for 3 years = 306000- 300000= 6000 <br>
if u invsted in fd with 8% interest 1 lakh for 1 year u will recieve - 8000 as interest <br>
what do you think , which  one is better?  <br>
lic wont give 10 % growth , maximum we can expect 7- 9 %  growth <br>
if u want to know more about financial planning and schemes , contact me @   nikhilvtk@gmail*** <br>
dont  take this insurance scheme
