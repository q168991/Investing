</script><p> Before you spend $0.01 on any investment, you must know what you’re doing, why you’re doing it and how to do it.  Before you invest in any security, the first investment you should make is in yourself, and the best investment you can make is by educating yourself.  <br>
 <br>
Begin your education by learning why you should invest and the importance of being able to make your own decisions or how the pro’s make theirs. Start your education by reading “Investing or Dummies” by Eric Tyson. <br>
To continue your education select some of the following  <br>

Websites that can provide instructions and help with procedures and terminology are Investopedia - http://***investopedia***/ http://***investorshub***/  and 1 Source for Stocks - http://***1source4stocks***/info/stock... or Smart Money  <br>
http://***smartmoney***/ <br>
Visit some of the more professional websites like  Zacks Research - http://***zacks***/ Investors Business Daily - http://***investors***/default.htm?fromad=1   <br>
Some of these web sites will have advertisers who are worth looking into also. And remember, if they offer free information, get it.   <br>
 <br>
Attend all the free seminars you can, just be careful and don’t get pressured into anything you really don’t want or need. Most schools offer courses in finance and economics, but very few will have courses on the mechanics of the investment markets, if they do try taking the course. You may want to consider on-line courses, the New York Institute of Finance use to have such courses. Try to get some fee information from The stocks exchanges they all have (had) free booklets, SIAC and some of the regulators (FINRA SEC MSRB CBOE) may provide some free literature. <br>
 <br>
And when you think you want to invest/trade, try some paper trading to test your skills without spending you money http://simulatorinvestopedia***/   http://***moneyworks4me***/  <br>
and/or http://***tradingsimulation***/  <br>
 <br>
Penny stocks ARE NOT for newbies.  Only those with trading experience should consider trading in pennies since they understand the market, the risk and the problems associated with penny stocks.  <br>
 <br>
Those with securities experience will tell you that you are foolish to start in the market by using penny stocks and those that are in business will tell you not to do it.    <br>
So with experienced investors/traders telling you not to do it, and those that are professional tell you not to do it, and even the Securities &amp; Exchange will not recommend you do it, why do you think you can make any money. <br>
 <br>
Before you enter an order for penny stock, read what the SEC has published regarding penny stocks http://***sec.gov/investor/pubs/microca… <br>
 <br>
You at least have made the right decision to start investing, this is the first big step and it won’t be your last. Keep taking those steps forward and along the way never take the advice from people that are not in the market or try to tell you not to invest. <br>
 <br>
Good luck on journey, study hard and you’ll invest well.

</script><p> Hi, <br>
Penny stocks, also known as cent stocks in some countries, are common shares of small public companies that trade at low prices per share. They are notoriously risky but if you follow a special method I&#039;ve learned you can earn good money at almost no risk. This is the site I use: http://pennystocks.toptips.org <br>
 <br>
I definitely recommend subscribing to this site in particular. Very good research, quality stocks. I was a bit weary of penny stocks from all the bad hype they receive but this guy is pretty legit. He&#039;s put my mind at ease with a lot of the fears I&#039;ve had. I especially like that he doesn&#039;t send out announcements left and right. I&#039;ve signed up for other websites that fill my in-box with one company after the other. I don&#039;t know where to even start with so many choices in front of me! Nathan sends me one idea a week and that&#039;s all I need. Working so many hours during the week leaves me with very little time when I get home to start doing tons of penny stock research. I&#039;m always eager to see what Nathan&#039;s next suggestion is each Friday and I love having time on the weekend to do my research.  <br>
 <br>
As said above if you want to make money with penny stocks you have to follow some proven methods. This one in my opinion is the best: http://pennystocks.toptips.org
        </p> A nobody offers some very sound advice. You should not make any actual investments for about 4 to 6 months, until  you fully understand the complexities of the stock market. When you do decide, thoroughly research the companies you want to invest in, before you commit. For relatively inexperienced investors, I would go more for long-term. Also keep away from penny stocks, unless you are 100% prepared to lose that money. Very few penny stock companies survive for long.   when you pick a broker look for ones that do not have ongoing fees; you should only have to pay for each trade transaction some of the banks have better transaction fees if you have a linked banking account with them. If you decide to use an IRA (Research it first) bear in mind that those investments could be locked away until you reach retirement age, so leave some reserves elsewhere for future needed expenses.
        </p> Penny stocks are loosely categorized companies with share prices of below $5 and with market caps of under $200 million. They are sometimes referred to as &quot;the slot machines of the equity market&quot; because of the money involved. There may be a good place for penny stocks in the portfolio of an experienced, advanced investor, however, if you follow this guide you will learn the most efficient strategies https://tr.im/4ed13
        </p> The best thing you can do is to read &quot;The intelligent investor by Benjamin Graham&quot;- a book Warren Buffet recommends often.  <br>
 <br>
Meanwhile you can read the basic thin you should look for before investing in a specific stock - an economic moat : <br>
 <br>
http://profit-investing***/what-is-a-moat/
        </p> Avoid penny stocks like the plague. <br>
Consider starting out with mutual funds or Exchange Traded Funds (ETF) to spread out your risk. <br>
 <br>
Try watching Mad Money with Jim Cramer on CNBC - he tries to teach about stocks and tries to make it fun at the same time.  You might also want to watch Fast Money that is on before Mad Money. <br>
 <br>
Also try reading Cramers books, or books by the Motley Fool brothers.
        </p> Read the book call the intelligent investor by Benjamin Graham.  A Book of Practical Counsel made more famous by the success of Warren Buffet as he continues to follow Graham&#039;s thinking. Saving money is hard but once you get started, the money would do all the work for you. You are going to experience bull and bear market but do not panic and look at the market as a long term opportunity. I strongly suggest that you get your self a Roth IRA account asap, if you do not have one. You can never go wrong with investing and saving for your future. You have many years of compound interest ahead of you. You could be a millionaire before you reach your retirement age so if you do not have a Roth IRA than get started with the Roth IRA account by contacting T-Rowe Price or Fidelity. It is suggested that you pick the Roth IRA target year fund set for the age 65. Three links below to get started with your investment needs. <br>
  <br>
https://individual.troweprice***/public... <br>
 https://***fidelity***/ <br>
 https://investor.vanguard***/corporate-... <br>
 <br>
  <br>
Get the Roth Account first than branch out into other investments, once you study and learn about investments. The target year account would adjust on its own. Don&#039;t waste your life and later on down the road, you would have alot of regrets. Take advantage of the company 401(k) or 403(b). Never leave free money on the table. Get this started today. <br>
 <br>
Always remember DO NOT invest through a bank or credit union with things such as stocks,bonds and IRAs because of their higher third party fees.Banks and credit unions are good for a few things such as loans and CDs anything else isn&#039;t worth the time.  Take Care
        </p> Ursuggardaddy was right. Set up an etrade account. This is the easiest way to get stock quotes and a very cheap way to buy and sell. Roth IRA&#039;s are great because when you take the money out at retirement, it is tax free. Free is my favorite four letter word. Lol
