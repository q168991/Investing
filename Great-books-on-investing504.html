</script><p> Investing for Dummies. <br>
This book is not for dummies at all.  <br>
It explained everything there is to know about investing - simply. <br>
Still don&#039;t understand options though. <br>

</script><p> Stock Trader&#039;s Almanac by Yale Hirsch and Jeffery Hirsch
        </p> My favorite is stock Market Wizards by Schwager.  It will teach you from the best in the business with Hedge Fund managers and fund managers with track records of beating the market and having high returns of over 20% per year.
        </p> Very good books are: <br>
&quot;How to make money in stocks&quot; by  William J. O&#039;Neil and &quot;Trend following&quot; by Michael Covel.  I also recommend &quot;Trade your way to financial freedom&quot; by Tharp.
