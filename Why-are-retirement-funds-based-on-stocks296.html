<h1>Why are retirement funds based on stocks?</h1>
<div class="answer">This may be a stupid question, but.... I am researching how to open my first retirement account. 

401(k)s and IRA&amp;#39;s appear to be totally based on stocks.  

Does this not seem crazy, and risky? 

Yes, I understand that &amp;quot;traditionally&amp;quot;, stocks perform the best... averaged over time.  And that putting money into mutual fund-type plans offers the least risk as it&amp;#39;s spread out over many stocks. 

But what if it so happens that when I&amp;#39;m ready to retire, the stock market plunges? Isn&amp;#39;t that...potentially very bad?  Didn&amp;#39;t this just happen to a lot of folks during this recession? 

Am I just missing something fundamental here?  I have never been thrilled about the idea of investing in stocks.  In my opinion the stock market is not really based on anything in reality and is essentially gambling.  

Are there portfolios within IRAs that allow you to choose less risky funds such as bonds?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Retirement plans offer a variety of options besides the stock market.  They have to, by law.  Many people are afraid of the stock market and do not understand it.  This is why alternatives are made available.  You can invest in bonds, money market funds, or guaranteed savings funds. <br>
 <br>
However no matter where you put your money you are gambling.  A lot of people forget that money (cash) is actually just a bunch of paper.  This paper is almost guaranteed to lose value over the long term because governments constantly print new cash to finance their deficits.  The rate at which money loses its value is called &quot;inflation&quot;.  You see this in the form of rising healthcare costs, gas prices, and food prices. <br>
 <br>
Many people have saved &quot;conservatively&quot; (no stocks) their entire lives only to be hit by a sudden surge of inflation right before they retire.  They may have expected to have plenty of money to live comfortably in retirement, but with the price of everything rising so quickly, they find themselves suddenly running out. <br>
 <br>
With stocks you actually become a part owner in a business.  This business owns hard assets such as real estate, food processing plants, electric utilities, factories, (whatever the business does).  When prices rise due to inflation, these businesses simply raise their prices.  Profits increase, and stock prices rise. <br>
 <br>
The stock market does look like a gamble at first.  Afterall there are plenty of day-traders and wall street banks competing with each other for short term gains, sending stock prices in all directions on a day to day basis.  However behind these fluctuations are actual growing businesses whose fundamental returns and value cannot be ignored. <br>
 <br>
It is best to diversify your retirement with a combination of stocks, as well as bonds and cash.  Believing that over the long term investing in cash is somehow less of a gamble than the stock market is naive.  Remember that the government is always printing money, a gamble on cash is a bet on the Federal Reserve.  Historically this hasn&#039;t proven itself to be a wise bet.  Over the past 100 years, the value of cash has declined by almost 97% due to inflation turning $1.00 into about 3 cents. Simultaneously the stock market gained about 10% annually turning 1 dollar into $13,780 today. <br>
 <br>
When you are younger and have a very long time before you retire it is best to invest in stocks.  As you get older and approach retirement it is generally wise to move more of your savings into bonds and cash so that a sudden short term market crash won&#039;t ruin your retirement plans.

</script><p> Your 401(k) should be diversified Mutual Funds. If it&#039;s anything else steer clear of it. I&#039;ve never heard of a Stocks-only 401k/IRA <br>
 <br>
I would check again, usually Retirement Plans have these types of investments: <br>
 <br>
Aggressive Growth -  <br>
 Mostly stocks (60% US stocks/25% Foreign Stocks/15% Bonds) <br>
 <br>
Growth - <br>
 Mostly Stocks, but with more bonds (50% US stocks/20% Foreign Stocks/25% Bonds/5% CDs) <br>
 <br>
Balanced -  <br>
 Balanced with stocks and bonds (35% US stocks/15% Foreign Stocks/40% Bonds/10% CDs) <br>
 <br>
Conservative -   <br>
 Mostly in bonds (15% US stocks/5% Foreign Stocks/50% Bonds/30% CDs) <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
When you are approaching retirement, you will want
        </p> IRAs and 401ks are just tax free accounts and do not define any investment, You as the owner of the account has a right to invest assets in a way you desire. Many people invest in stocks since over the long run, they generally perform better than bonds or other investments. <br>
 <br>
When someone starts to approach retirement, it may be advisable to invest some of the assets in a retirement account in less risky bonds or other investments.
        </p> In an IRA and usually in a 401k you have the option of investing in stocks, bonds or cash such as money markets.  A  You dont have to invest it all in stocks and you shouldnt, because the market could crash just when when you are ready to retire and you could lose much of what you gained.  You should spread your risk among those as you get closer to retirement.
        </p> With an IRA you can typically find a program that will let you do almost anything: <br>
Mutual funds, bonds, and money market are the most common and all main stream funds would allow you to invest and any of these. <br>
 <br>
But there are funds that allow investment in real estate, venture capitalism, almost anything you can think of...
        </p> they are not based on stocks since stock exchange investmnts fetch more income say 15% or more  <br>
some are attracted towards it that is all and some pf companies invest the deposits/subscriptions in stock market it is like taking shop coconut and offer it to way side pillaiyar
