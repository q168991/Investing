<h1>How to start investing???</h1>
<div class="answer">My husband and I are interested in starting to invest. But we have no idea how! I&amp;#39;m 19, he&amp;#39;s 21-- and none of our family invests. Where do you start? What to invest in? How much to invest? We have about $300 extra a month for investing. Bonds? Stocks? I&amp;#39;m so lost! If someone could lay it all out for me I&amp;#39;d really appreciate it!! Thanks!<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> The following link is to a financial columnist&#039;s website.  I&#039;ve been reading his articles for 15 years and follwing his advice.  I&#039;d highly recommend you read through his stuff, especially his &quot;couch potato portfolio&quot;. <br>
 <br>
You are doing good to start thinking about this at a young age.  Here are some basics to consider. <br>
 <br>
Start with a savings account and put your $300 per month in there until you have 3-6 months of living expenses saved up. <br>
 <br>
If you have jobs and your employer has a 401-k with matching funds, put in enough to at least get the match. <br>
 <br>
Start with index mutual funds.  Trying to pick individual stocks or bonds without a lot of time spent researching them can lead to bad decisions and you could lose money easily.  Don&#039;t pay a lot of attention to anyone who claims to have a &quot;hot stock pick&quot;. <br>
 <br>
Keep in mind that the market will have it&#039;s ups and downs but over nearly all 10 year periods, it has returned a positive gain.  You have 40 years to recover from any short-term down markets so don&#039;t worry about them too much. <br>
 <br>
The website below has a lot of good information so spend some time reading.  With 40 years of earning towards your goals, you have lots of time.  Time is your most valuable asset so use it wisely.

</script><p> Good job saving $100 (or more) per month that you can save or invest. <br>
 <br>
1. What you can do is open a brokerage account such as: <br>
 <br>
E*Trade <br>
TD Ameritrade <br>
 <br>
They offer many kinds of accounts, and you buy and sell stocks, and mutual funds. The minimum to open each account is $1000. <br>
 <br>
2. Then, choose a mutual fund with a minimum you can afford. Look through your brokerage mutual fund list, and only choose mutual funds that have no-load or no transaction fee. You can then visit Morningstar*** and look for 4 or 5 star mutual funds. <br>
 <br>
In order to have a diversified portfolio, you can have three mutual funds: <br>
1. Diversified International Mutual Fund <br>
2. Large Capitalization USA Mutual Fund <br>
3. Small Capitalization USA Mutual Fund <br>
 <br>
If you don&#039;t have that much money to start with, you can start with one mutual fund. And as you have more money to invest, you can start investing in another mutual fund, and so forth until you have three mutual funds. <br>
 <br>
3. Setup automatic investing using your Brokerage account. You can automatically invest at regular intervals (for example, once a month), and the system will automatically invest for you whether the market goes up or down.  <br>
 <br>
Over the years, with the growth of the stock market (on average, gains around 10% per year over many years. Yes, some years, you could lose 10% and other years, gain 20%), you&#039;ll be amazed how much money you can accumulate! <br>
 <br>
 <br>
What if you don&#039;t have $1000 saved?  <br>
 <br>
I was researching mutual fund companies to see if they allowed a very low minimum to start an account (such as $50). I wasn&#039;t satisfied with the results. <br>
 <br>
So what I recommend is open a high yield money market or savings account which, at this time, should get you at least 5%. Then when you have $1000, you can open the brokerage account and invest at regular intervals in mutual funds as described above. You can also open a Complete Savings Account at E*Trade (getting 5.05% at this time). Then, when you are ready to open a Brokerage account at E*Trade, you can link both accounts (your complete savings account and your brokerage account) to the same E*Trade login/account. <br>

        </p> I was paying a broker too much money for what I was getting. I decided to let go of my broker (in October 2008- which is significant) and invest on my own. My bank offers on-line banking. I made an appointment with the investment banker and she showed me the ropes. I do my own research and I decide which stocks I will buy. I like having the control to buy and sell stocks and I have some good hunches that have made me a nice profit. There are sites that charge a nominal fee, and I truly mean nominal, like $7.00 for a transaction but I prefer investing through my bank. My stock portfolio is there at a click of a button along with my banking. I think you might like going through your bank if you are new to investing. Good luck.
        </p> No-load, low-cost mutual funds are a great place to invest if you have low amounts of money and wish to invest at periodic intervals.  The leaders in this area are ***vanguard*** and ***fidelity*** .  They know that costs matter in the long run.  Small differences in costs compound to very large differences in wealth over long periods of time. <br>
 <br>
You will want to get a basic education on mutual fund investing.  It is not hard, but you&#039;ll need to know enough to avoid the major pitfalls.  So, just get ready to set aside about 10 - 20 hours of reading.  However, once you develop the basic knowledge, you will be able to use it for the rest of your life.  I have 3 good recommendations.  Any of these will help: <br>
 <br>
1)  Mutual Funds for Dummies, by Eric Tyson.  IMO, this book should be issued to all high school grads.  I cannot recommend this book enough. <br>
 <br>
2)  http://***invest-for-retirement*** has a free downladable book, written by me.  I am not associated with any investing firm.  I am actually a pharmacist with a passion for teaching people about investing.  Although the book is geared towards retirement, you will learn basic investing info as well.  And, if you don&#039;t like the book, then fret not ... you didn&#039;t pay a single penny for it.  Of particular interest, chapters 19 and 23 are the most useful of the whole book. <br>
 <br>
3)  The Boglehead&#039;s Guide to Investing <br>
 <br>
To be a successful investor, you will need to learn the following.  Look for the the following topics in whatever you read: <br>
 <br>
-  The difference between a lending investment (like bonds) and an ownership investment (like stock), and the advantages/disadvantages to each. <br>
 <br>
-  The importance of asset allocation in determining your overall risk and return.  In particular, the stock to bond ratio.   <br>
 <br>
-  Why do we rebalance our portfolios? <br>
 <br>
-  The impact of costs over long periods of time. <br>
 <br>
-  How past performance is about as useful as reading tea leaves for predicting future performance.  Why past performance is not a good reason to pick a mutual fund. <br>
 <br>
-  What is an &quot;Efficient Market&quot;, and why is it rare for a mutual fund manager to beat the market average over long periods of time? <br>
 <br>
-  What are Index Funds and why do they prevail most of the time? <br>
 <br>
-  The concept of Reversion-to-the-Mean and its implication to investors. <br>
 <br>
Let me end my speal by giving you the three basic tenets of an intelligent investor, by Benjamin Graham (world renouned author): <br>
 <br>
1)  You must understand what you invest in. <br>
2)  You must strive for adequate, not extraordinary, returns. <br>
3)  You must deliberately protect yourself from serious losses.
        </p> It is good that you are starting to think about investing at an early age.  Many people delay and start to panic as retirement approaches. <br>
 <br>
The first thing to do is sign up for your company&#039;s 401(k), if it offers one.  This allows you to reduce your current tax bill by putting pre-tax money into a retirement account.  Whatever money you put into this account will be deducted from your taxable income and can grow until you retire, shielded from taxes.  Many employers match your contribution up to a certain percentage of income.  This money is tax-deferred too.  Try to put aside the percentage that your employer will match, as it is like giving yourself an automatic raise. <br>
 <br>
Next, you should put money into an HSBC Direct or ING Direct account.  You get around a 5% return and you do not need to worry about your investment going down in value.  This money you can set aside for major purchases, like buying a house, or for rainy days.  You can access your money easily and you earn much more money in those accounts than you would in a bank&#039;s saving account. <br>
 <br>
Once you have a cushion, you should look at index funds.  Vanguard has low fees, but the initial investment is often high.  You should probably get a fund that tries to match the performance of the S&amp;P500 index, which is a good measure of the US stock market performance.  You should also invest about 15% of your money in an index that tracks international markets.  By investing in both markets, you reduce your risk of losing money and your risk-adjusted return is higher than investing in the US market alone. <br>
 <br>
Kiplinger magazine often lists &quot;Best Mutual Funds.&quot;  You can begin picking some of those as you have more money set aside.  You should probably buy some mutual funds in an IRA account, which is another way to reduce your taxes and let your money grow for your retirement. <br>
 <br>
You should begin buying individual stocks only after you have a good deal of money set aside for present-day expenditures and only after you feel comfortable investing. <br>
 <br>
Good luck and I hope you have fun.
        </p> Your decision to start investing is a good one.  An easy way to start learning about investing is to create a &quot;practice&quot; portfolio at http://***top10traders*** - the site is free - each month the site ranks the best-performing investors.  You can get investing ideas from the best investors.
        </p> Mutual funds or index funds would probably be better for begginers, I really like working with a company called vanguard that offers low cost index funds. You might want to try just typing in Investing for begginers into a yahoo search to read up on the topics, that&#039;s how I got started.
        </p> The easiest way is to go to your library and pick up books on investing and finance. I&#039;ve only read about 10 books in the last 6 months and feel totally comfortable investing. <br>
 <br>
Don&#039;t try to find a magic way to invest where you don&#039;t have to do or study anything. That is NEVER going to work. Read the books, search the net and ask people how to do it. Become totally knowlegeable and literate on investing and you WILL succeed. I didn&#039;t say you might or could. Learn how to do it and you WILL succeed. <br>
 <br>
By the way, never forget this: <br>
 <br>
Stocks are for losers! Never buy stock! Trade options and be happy! But first, learn how to do it!
        </p> This is where you start: learning the business. <br>
 <br>
Read, do courses...way before you invest. <br>
 <br>
You must invest in your education. <br>
I include a video for you to watch..the site is a membership <br>
site where you can learn and get support.
