</script><p> Brilliant.... a stranger whose qualifications and motives can never be known is a great way to find good investments.  Besides... they know nothing about you!  How perfect is that? <br>
 <br>
You have two choices; <br>
Go to a full service broker (Edward Jones is a great choice). The biggest negative is the high commissions. Most brokers are concerned about you.  Some don&#039;t care.  You may never be able to tell the difference. <br>
 <br>
Learn about Mutual Funds and invest in no-load, low fee Mutual Funds.  Read at least 2-3 books on the subject. Learn about risk &amp; asset allocation.  If you can&#039;t do this.... go to a full service broker as explained above.

RE: <br>

I would like to know what is the best way to invest 40000 dollars that yields high profits and have low risks of failing.
        </p> Banks are a safe investment, but don&#039;t even think <br>
about a bank, since the interest rates are to low. <br>
I would advise a mutual fund that is balanced or <br>
has an asset allocation (invest in stocks, bonds <br>
and cash instruments.) Some good fund companies <br>
are Fidelity, Vanguard and TR Price. Use this link <br>
to find out about mutual funds. <br>

        </p> It depends on your horizon.  1 to 2 years, then I would put it into a fixed deposit making 1% to 2% interest.  If more like 7 to 10 years, stock is the way to go.
        </p>
