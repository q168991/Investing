</script><p> There&#039;s more to consider than just price.  If they&#039;re slow on executing a trade, you can lose more there than you save by getting a commission that&#039;s a buck or two cheaper.  Here&#039;s a list SmartMoney put together a year or two ago: http://***smartmoney***/brokers/index.... <br>
 <br>
It&#039;s a little outdated (e.g. TD Waterhouse and Ameritrade have merged into TDAmeritrade and charge $9.99 now), but still gives you some good information. <br>
 <br>
I&#039;ve been happy with TDAmeritrade and I&#039;ve heard plenty of people happy with Scottrade as well.

        </p> there became a study completed with monkeys, kindergardners and inventory brokers. kindergardners picked the shares they knew: Disney, toys&#039;r&#039;us, etc. inventory brokers did it their way. Ststistics, etc. And the monkeys picked shares with the help of throwing darts at a wall.. long tale short.... inventory brokers got here in final. monkeys 2d, and kindergardners got here in first... p.c.. shares you comprehend of and purchase products from.
