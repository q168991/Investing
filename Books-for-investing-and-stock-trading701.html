</script><p> Warren Buffett mentions every year that he advises everyone to read his former mentor&#039;s book &quot;The Intelligent Investor&quot; <br>
 <br>
Also, I recently talked with Mark Fischer, multimillionaire trader who owns the biggest clearing firm at the New York Mercantile Exchange who wrote a book called &quot;The Logical Trader&quot; which uses stats and math to come up with the best probable points to buy anything based upon moving averages and timelines. <br>
 <br>
Either one of these would be great reads (or you could read both)

        </p> Hi i have recently created a blog designed to help and inform people about the stock market and trading . i am also documenting my own trades on this web site . currently it only has a small amount of information as i have only just started it but i would greatly encourage you to come and join the blog and learn and also contribute to it yourself with your own experiences . hopefully overtime if enough people join and contribute it become a wealth of information , thanks <br>

        </p> Read a &quot;Random Walk Down Wall Street&quot;  it will give you tremendous insight into how efficient markets operate, and how prices are set.   It will illustrate why it is particularly difficult to beat the market.
        </p> &quot;Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets&quot; <br>
 <br>
The best book you will find as an introduction to a wide range of technical analysis methods.
        </p> Buffett recommends The Intelligent Investor, and I believe you can actually download it for free.
        </p> Read Cramer&#039;s &quot;real money sane investing in an insane world&quot;.  I would highly recommend it.
        </p>
