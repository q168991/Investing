<h1>How can I invest in stock market?</h1>
<div class="answer">I graduated high school last month. I want to invest in stock market. But, I have never invested in stock market. I want to invest stocks in online.
1) To invest, do I need to make a special account? Where can I make it? I have an account in UMB bank.
2) To trade stocks, which programs do I need?
3) Can you sugest any books for beginners?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> You need to open an account with stock exchange through your broker and deposit some initial amount.   <br>
 <br>
To trade you need charting software&#039;s / trading software/terminal and data feeds this all will be provided by your broker at some fees / may be free. <br>
 <br>
There are lot of books / strategies  you can search the net. <br>

        </p> I wouldn&#039;t jump right in to it. Research the issues first and be certain that any money invested is money that you can afford to lose. Remember, all investments in the market are not winners. Some lose big time. First hand, you should have 3-6 months of funds available in an accessible account for emergency funds. Don&#039;t ever go without this if you&#039;re going to invest in the market as that rainy day could be just around the corner. Literature from brokerage houses or the NYSE could be a place to start learning.
        </p> Try Scottrade or TdAmeritrade.  I think there is a $1000 minimum. <br>
 <br>
Become familiar with the online resources like Yahoo Finance.  When you see an interesting stock, put it in a Portfolio.  Keep notes, possibly in a spreadsheet, about why you like it and what signals you would use to sell.  I usually buy 1 share and enter the date and price. <br>
 <br>
Motley Fool as portfolios for people like Jim Cramer.  They have names like &quot;TrackCramer&quot;.  I think the one I liked was TrackHeebner. <br>
 <br>
Every library has stock market books.   <br>
 <br>
If you find a few stocks that interest you, I can give some pointeres on those stocks.  Just post another question in this forum. <br>
 <br>
Last thought.  Go to Meetup*** and look for stock trading clubs in your area. <br>

        </p> 1 &amp; 2  Open using an online broker.  TD Ameritrade has a lot of great free software it gives you with the account. <br>
3. You need a stock buying strategy.  You just don&#039;t buy and hope a stock up.   Buy  Wallstreet Money Machine on line from amazon used.  Easy reading, it has a strategy that gives you fast trading, (not day trading) with returns in a short period of time of 10 - 15%.   <br>
Strategy is everything.  Don&#039;t pay over $10.00 a trade for brokerage fees.  You might be able to open an account for $500.
        </p> Hi , Firstly please tell your country name so that better results and one can guode you better . <br>

But I can tell you some tips about investments. <br>
firstly tell your view that are you investor or want to becomee a day trader ? <br>
If you are investor then always do work in 3 calling plan . for e.g-- <br>
Always work with 3 calls plan on that stock . <br>
the first call is your investment . <br>
the 2nnd call , when it comes half from your investment , then put same money on it . <br>
the 3rd call when it will half from your 2nd call then put same money in it . <br>
For eg if some body buy 1000 shares @ 1.50 . and this stock come at .75 , then take 1000 more share on .75 , and if this stock comes .30 then buy 1000 more shares , and this is your last call .  <br>
Now when this stock comes on your first call , your 3 rd call make your money multiply by 3 , and 2 nd call make your money 2x , so that’s the way to do work in these types of share . <br>
There is no stoploss in those shares , and don`t panic . <br>

        </p> Open an account with a discount broker.  Your bank is no friend of yours.  Talk face to face with a discount broker near your home.   The discount broker can move you your account with the bank into your account with the discount broker.  I would spend as much time with a broker who will take the time to explain the workings of the general market and ask you what your investment goals.  You should ask yourself what kind of investor you want to be.  Such as growth, income, or trader.  All of your decisions should be based on your risk tolerance.  Not in theory; but, with your real money on the line.  Then read a book that fits your type of investing.

         You can make money in binary options only if you treat it as a real form of investing. Learn here https://tr.im/gXLVR <br>
 <br>
This means learning how it works, learning how to read charts and learning how you can make accurate predictions. All these are not that difficult but it takes some time. If you treat it as gambling and just make random predictions then you will obviously not win.
        </p> here&#039;s the book you need &#039;little book of of big dividends.&#039; Go to Amazon and look it up.  <br>
 <br>
After you set up a brokerage, I&#039;d give one huge word of advice and its real simple. <br>
 <br>
Try to at least buy shares in bundles of 100 if you can. That way if it goes up a dollar, you know you&#039;re up $100. If you buy ten shares here, forty there, and thirty there... you pay a lot in brokerage fees everytime you buy and sell so it cuts into your profit.
