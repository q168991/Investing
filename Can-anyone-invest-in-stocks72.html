<h1>Can anyone invest in stocks?</h1>
<div class="answer">I&amp;#39;ve never really understood stocks but i&amp;#39;ve heard stories about how people become wealthy to an extent in months, sometimes weeks. My question is can anyone invest in stocks? Even somebody with a low to average salary?

</script><p> Yes anyone can invest in stocks, and if you dont have a broker that you would go through, online banks like E*Trade allow you to do so... <br>
 <br>
E*trade <br>
Ameritrade <br>
scottsdale <br>
 <br>
i think those 3 allow you to open a bank account with them and invest through them, I have E*trade, they charge like $13 per trade/sell <br>
 <br>
but if u research what you are investing into just even a little bit, you could make that back pretty quickly.

I&amp;#39;ve never really understood stocks but i&amp;#39;ve heard stories about how people become wealthy to an extent in months, sometimes weeks. My question is can anyone invest in stocks? Even somebody with a low to average salary? How does one go about buying stocks?
        </p> First, take 6 months in learning about stocks and trying it out with fake money in a stimulation web site like Yahoo! Finance. <br>
 <br>
***finance.yahoo*** <br>
 <br>
The stocks you want to focus on is consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and healthcare. These are DEFENSIVE stocks that will survive through good and bad times. Most of my positions are in these stocks. Some names include 3M, Procter &amp; Gamble, Kimberly Clark, Exxon Mobil, Walmart, Costco. Everybody&#039;s got to eat and wipe their butts regardless of the state of economy. Many of these companies survived through the Great Depression. <br>
 <br>
That&#039;s the benefits. You can sleep at night knowing your money is doing well. There are NO guarantees that you won&#039;t lose money. It&#039;s just that these stocks are the best. They pay good dividends too. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
 <br>
If you&#039;re new to stocks, DON&#039;T DAY TRADE. You&#039;ll a rookie in a world of professionals. I tried day-trading with Citigroup and AIG when they were a little bit over $1. I had some luck at first, making about $30 a day but I was way over my head. My luck didn&#039;t last long and I had to rethink my strategy. <br>
 <br>
Besides you can&#039;t do much with $100 in the market. Day trading involves A LOT of commissions to the broker. With all the commissions deducted from each trade, you&#039;ll be lucky if you only lose half your money. <br>
 <br>
I would just day trade using Yahoo! Finance. Open a stimulation account, give yourself $100 worth of fake money and play it in the stimulation format. You&#039;ll see what I mean by losing money every easily. <br>
 <br>
Good luck.
        </p> yes anyone can invest in stocks. you either have to go to an actual broker and a financial institution or you can start up an online account such as e*trade*** or fidelity***. You have to keep money in an account, and there are costs per trade. Money can be made in the stock market, but be careful cuz money can also be lost. My uncle actually makes a living working from home and trading. so i know it can be done. but i&#039;ve seen people have to file bankruptcy because of it too. If your looking for a get rich quick thing, then ur in the wrong place, the stock market takes patience and research.
        </p> Yes, anyone can put money into stocks... it&#039;s just a matter of finding the right stocks, and having enough to buy the stocks.  You buy a stock for a certain amount of money... Lets say 1 stock in Milk is $1.00  and you buy 40 stocks ... Then when the stocks of milk goes up to $2.00 , you&#039;re stock is now worth $80.00 ... Minus the $40.00 you originally bought it for you&#039;ve made $40.00 ... BUT ONLY IF YOU SELL IT... Stocks are just potential money.   I would go through a stock broker, or see what you can learn on ETRADE...
        </p> Simplest way to start is to open an account with Fidelity, Charles Schwab or one of the financial companies.  Open a mutual fund account and make regular deposits.  Buying no load mutual funds so every penny invested buys shares.  Once you educate yourself on what stocks are money makers then you can use your account to buy shares in a particular company.  Buying 100 shares in a company is just the beginning.
