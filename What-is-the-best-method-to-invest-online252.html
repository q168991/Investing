</script><p> Most mutual fund companies will have an option to open an account online. You will have to enter in some information about your bank account so that you can have the money transfered over to purchase the fund with. There are other ways. You can always open up a brokerage account like with E-trade or TD Ameritrade, or Scott trade. You can purchase mutual funds through them and also stocks and other investments. However when you go through a brokerage account there are additional fees that you would have to pay. IF you are planning on being an active trade the brokerage account is the way to go. If you are just going to buy a mutual fund or two and let them grow for a few years.. go direct to the fund. It&#039;s more cost efficient. I personally use Vanguard funds because they have very low management fees and good performance.
        </p> You will recieve all sorts of answers, theories and people advertising. <br>
 <br>
First of all stick with Schwab, Etrade, etc. You may be able to save a small buck or two with some of the discount places but it is best to stick with super established businesses. Etrade is good if you are starting super small. I use Citibank for a number of reasons. Yes you do have to open an account first. But you can do all of your trading online for mutuals and such. Plus Citibank being the largest bank on the planet has branches everywhere including India. If you need acsess to cash something out you can just do it and not wait. For just messing around with individual stocks I use Etrade.  <br>
 <br>
As far as where to get advice there are a lot of opinions. Citibank and such offers a lot of tools. But there is no substitute for reading. Learning the basics of mutuals such as what percentage you put into what (your age, some high risk, some low, etc.). Start out conservative at first until you get more knowledge.  <br>
 <br>
Again I have an account that I play with on etrade. Its money I can afford to lose out of my portfolio. The reason is individual trading rarely pays off. Good solid mutuals and stocks that grow are the way to go. But by playing a bit you will gain some knowledge.  <br>
 <br>
Again, read, read and read some more!
        </p> You have to open an online trading account and a demat account.  <br>
Please get in to touch with ICICI Bank / HDFC bank / UTI bank or Sharekhan. These entities offer online trading facility for dealing in share market as well as commodities market. They also offer direct investments in IPO and Mutual fund units. <br>
 <br>
You can learn and collate lot of related information from the websites of these entities.  <br>
 <br>
Best of luck.
        </p> I invest on Sharebuilder*** and its only 4 dollars a month and it come directly out of my checking account. About the advice I don&#039;t really know, everyone in the world is willing to give you their opinion, but the person you can really trust is yourself. Just play around with it for a while and go with your gut instinct.
