<h1>Can someone tell me a good book on learning about investing?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am a teen very interested in the stock market and want to invest in a stock soon; but i don&amp;#39;t know to much about the terms and dialect about the stock market and especially when i watch shows like Mad Money. I want a book that&amp;#39;s good for a 16 year old but that is a challanging &amp; complex. It should also be written by a reputable author. 

Thanks!<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> I would recommend either Stock Trading for Dummies or Investing for Dummies. They are both very easy to understand and cover the basic terms and concepts of stock trading and investing. That&#039;s where I started a number of years back. I have gone on to major in finance and currently work at a major investment firm. Those books wont quite get you to that point, but I though I&#039;d throw it out there so you would value my opinion a little more. <br>
 <br>
Also, do yourself a favor and check them out from your local library rather than buy them. If you decide they aren&#039;t for you, just check out a different book. If your library is anything like the one I go to, their system will recommend books to you that are similar to the ones you have checked out before.
