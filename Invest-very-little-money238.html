<h1>Invest very little money?</h1>
<div class="answer">For the first time in a while I have a little extra cash. Instead of blowing it like I normally do, I though I might invest it. I am only 22 and know literally nothing about investments. I know I should do research but its too confusing for me. I have between $100 and $400 to invest. How can I at least double this money if not much more?

Any websites or companies anyone has dealt with would be really helpful.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> I don&#039;t think that,having kids takes a lot of effort and time obviously but it has many rewards that make it worth it.I know people without kids and they have it far from easy.Life can be difficult for all at times. I am a little confused though as in another question you did say that you loved your life,you can do whatever you want and have never had any mean comments about being child free?Have you just started wearing a t shirt in the past couple of days with &quot;I&#039;m child free,go to hell.&quot;on or something?Something like that would explain the comments...
        </p> I don&#039;t think it&#039;s the right time to invest in the current stock market now. It&#039;s volatile and downside is more obvious. Build your capital and invest in yourself to learn more about investing. When the market is recovering, you can position yourself better. <br>
