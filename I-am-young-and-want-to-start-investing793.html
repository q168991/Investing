Before you spend $0.01 on any investment, you must know what you’re doing, why you’re doing it and how to do it.  Before you invest in any security, the first investment you should make is in yourself, and the best investment you can make is by educating yourself.  <br>
 <br>
Begin your education by learning why you should invest and the importance of being able to make your own decisions or how the pro’s make theirs. Start your education by reading “Investing or Dummies” by Eric Tyson. <br>
To continue your education select some of the following  <br>

Websites that can provide instructions and help with procedures and terminology are Investopedia - http://***investopedia***/ http://***investorshub***/  and 1 Source for Stocks - http://***1source4stocks***/info/stock... or Smart Money  <br>
http://***smartmoney***/ <br>
Visit some of the more professional websites like  Zacks Research - http://***zacks***/   Investors Business Daily - http://***investors***/default.htm?fromad=1   <br>
Some of these web sites will have advertisers who are worth looking into also. And remember, if they offer free information, get it.   <br>
 <br>
Attend all the free seminars you can, just be careful and don’t get pressured into anything you really don’t want or need. Most schools offer courses in finance and economics, but very few will have courses on the mechanics of the investment markets, if they do try taking the course. You may want to consider on-line courses, the New York Institute of Finance use to have such courses. Try to get some fee information from The stocks exchanges they all have (had) free booklets, SIAC and some of the regulators (FINRA SEC MSRB CBOE) may provide some free literature. <br>
 <br>
And when you think you want to invest/trade, try some paper trading to test your skills without spending you money http://simulatorinvestopedia***/   http://***moneyworks4me***/  <br>
and/or http://***tradingsimulation***/  <br>
 <br>
You at least have made the right decision to start investing, this is the first big step and it won’t be your last. Keep taking those steps forward and along the way never take the advice from people that are not in the market or try to tell you not to invest. <br>
 <br>
Good luck on journey, study hard and you’ll invest well.

</script><p> No, you&#039;re no longer too youthful to commence making an investment. even with the undeniable fact that, i could recommend letting a great broker provider handle it. As on your 2nd question, the economic equipment is undesirable on the 2nd yet for a affected person and sensible investor funds may well be made in it in case you make investments nicely. it incredibly is the reason I recommend letting a broker provider handle the problem. in the previous you opt for for a broker provider, be confident to do a super variety of study into all your concepts. study as much as you could approximately making an investment on your person to shelter your self and additionally pave a thank you to you dealing with your person figuring out to purchase and promotion activities. *Edit* I see lots have reported no because of the fact the economic equipment could falter much extra. on an identical time because it incredibly is real and is between the negative aspects of making an investment, you could no longer bypass into debt. in case you have been to take a position in a failed inventory, you basically lose your funds. ought to you identify to take a position do it properly. in case you identify that the industry isn&#039;t precise for you, open a severe yeild reductions account quite.

        </p> Its better to lay the foundation now so that it would be a lot easy within the future. Saving money is hard but once you get started, the money would do all the work for you. I strongly suggest that you get your self a Roth IRA account asap, if you do not have one. You can never go wrong with investing and saving for your future. You have many years of compound interest ahead of you. You could be a millionaire before you reach your retirement age so if you do not have a Roth IRA than get started with the Roth IRA account by contacting T-Rowe Price or Fidelity. It is suggested that you pick the Roth IRA target year fund set for the age 65.  <br>

https://***fidelity***/ <br>

  <br>
 <br>
Get the Roth Account first than branch out into other investments, once you study and learn about investments. The target year account would adjust on its own. Don&#039;t waste your life and later on down the road, you would have alot of regrets. Take advantage of the company 401(k) or 403(b). Never leave free money on the table. Get this started today. <br>
  <br>
As far as investing, Never invest through a bank or credit union with things such as stocks,bonds and IRAs because of their higher third party fees..If the companies would not consider your $250 then do not get up set just simply Research I-Bonds while sticking some of your money within a savings account at the credit union along with other investments. Research I-Bonds and you would see that you would get a fixed rate along with a variable semiannual inflation rate based on changes in the Consumer Price Index for all Urban Consumers (CPI-U). The catch is you have to leave the money within the account for 1year and if you withdrawal the money before the 5year mature date, you would have to pay back 3months interests on your money. You can not lose money and your money would always stay above the inflation rate by investing within I-Bonds anyway you can start with as little as $25 and the max to put into the account per year is 10K.. Once again if they do not want to accept your $250.00 then save and get the account up to 1,000,2500 or whatever the minimal balance is within the company then seek investing with them <br>
