</script><p> $500 is simply too little to invest.  <br>
 <br>
An introductory book like _Stock Markets for Dummies_ is a good place to start.  <br>
 <br>
Investors Business Daily (IBD) is a solid daily resource (and its complement, ***investors*** ). It&#039;s a better newspaper than the Wall Street Journal and it is built around a particular approach to trading. You could read _How to Make Money in Stocks_ by William O&#039;Neil too--he&#039;s the founder of IBD.  <br>
 <br>
Search your local library for other books on stock investing. Try to absorb as much knowledge and understanding as you can. Eventually, you should open a brokerage account and paper trade for a while--this is practice (not real money), which you should do extensively before you put any real money at risk.

</script><p> I&#039;d suggest getting a brokerage account at scottrade. The minimum requirement is 500 dollars and you can drop below that if necessary. They have extremely low commissions at 7 dollars and you can trade about 15 ETFs for free. They also hold weekely seminars for newbys and their knowledge center gives you an array of ...well...knowledge on investing. But what you shouldn&#039;t do is think you&#039;re going to make millions just by getting an account. Investing is tricky and the last thing you want to do is run into something you don&#039;t understand. You should worry first about understanding the stock and bond markets and how they work before choosing to invest. I&#039;d suggest watching Mad Money at 3pm pacific time, I&#039;m guessing it&#039;s 6pm Eastern Time...with Jim Kramer. He&#039;s pretty smart and his hour long show deals with all the forces that make prices change. You need to understand the strategies. Did you know you can make money on stocks that aren&#039;t moving at all and you can make money on stocks that are moving down, and you can make money without ever owning a stock (options) there are a lot of ways to invest with the stock market but you need to know what you are doing first. I&#039;d highly recommend putting that 500 bucks into a brokerage account like scottrade and then putting 20 bucks a week in it while watching a few stocks and learning more...don&#039;t invet immediately but build some capital. Look at the stocks you chose and see where they went, you might be surprised to find what they do and might thank yourself for no jumping head first into the stock market...remember a successful invester is a smart investor. Most successful investors are also long term investors
        </p> A mutual fund account is going to be your best option. Its a professionally managed investment account where you have a broker balancing your portfolio with different types of investments. Its less risky investment style and will allow you to dip your toes into the stock market. By balancing out your portfolio you will decrease your risk of losing your money. However, less risky investments don&#039;t get paid off the same way risky investments do. If a risky investment goes well the payoff can be tremendous. You must realize you get paid for taking risks. At the same time, if your risky investment doesn&#039;t succeed you risk losing it all. That is why just starting off a mutual fund would be your best investment. You can follow everything your investor does and learn how the stock market works while exploring other investment opportunities as well. Your investor might find other options besides stock to help balance your portfolio. So don&#039;t take the risk just yet. Educate yourself on the market and different opportunities available to you first. Also please know that $500 is an extremely small amount of money to invest. To put it in perspective for you one share of Apple stock is currently trading for around $403.71. So don&#039;t be surprised if you don&#039;t get a lot for your money. Investments are pricey. You have to have money to make money.
        </p> $500 is a savings account, not an investment.  Unless you have a very large sum, or a recurrent amount to invest on a regular basis, I&#039;d stick to a savings account.
