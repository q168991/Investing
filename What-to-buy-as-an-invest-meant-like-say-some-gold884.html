</script><p> For most people who invest in gold, it&#039;s not exactly an &quot;item&quot; in that you don&#039;t have to possess it.  You buy it with the hope that it will increase in value, sort of like stock shares. <br>
 <br>
Which bring us to the second point:  If anyone really knew what will increase in value by the end of the year, everyone would buy it (and then it probably wouldn&#039;t).

</script><p> I would stay away from all liquidities and anything that has to do with Forex. It is really too risky and is based solely on expectation and government (which is evil). Try your luck with shares instead. And no you cannot convert paper gold into real gold as it is kept in some distant and secure place to the point where it would be both silly and expensive. You can always however sell the paper gold and then buy gold bars immediately after however I&#039;m not sure of a place where you can actually buy gold bars.
        </p> While Gold is at a very high price right now as some others noted, theres still alot of room for it to go up, right now Greece is on the verge of collapse and If Portugal, Spain, Ireland, and Iceland follow suit the Euro could collapse which would make gold skyrocket even further. At the moment silver is pretty undervalued due to heavy price manipulation and would also make a good investment.
        </p> If you can&#039;t spell the word investment, then you seriously need a financial adviser. Why not put your money into a safe, but rapidly growing mutual fund? You can end up building quite a fortune, securely too. Look for a financial adviser in your area, so they can help you invest your money in the right things.
        </p> Well, since gold is at an all-time high, that seems like a pretty foolish choice.  I would buy LOW. <br>
 <br>
 <br>
The best investments are investment items (stocks and bonds).  Why on earth would you want to buy a physical item?!!???
        </p> Just follow these steps. I&#039;ve dumbed it down to the easiest, yet safest way to win in the Forex. <br>
 <br>
1) Open a live account at http://bit.ly/iPV25O <br>
2) Select AAAFx broker, and open MICRO account with 200:1 leverage. <br>
3) Deposit at least $300 in your account to start. <br>
4) &quot;Add to Portfolio&quot; the top 20 strategies at http://bit.ly/mJiyZV <br>
5) ...when adding strategies, set maximum number of trades to 5, and... <br>
6) ...select lot size of 0.1 &quot;mini&quot; lots for each $1000 in your account. <br>
7) It will trade automatically, following all those top 20 strategies. <br>
8) Then sit back, relax and take a vacation as you make easy Forex money.
