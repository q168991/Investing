<h1>Gambling or investing - what exactly is the difference?</h1>
<div class="answer">To some extent, all investing is a gamble.

And most gamblers at least try to &amp;quot;play the odds&amp;quot;.... is that so different from investing?

What exactly is the line that distinguishes investing from gambling?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> the main reason investing is equated to gambling is because like in gambling it&#039;s a crooked game , lots of crooks and liars invole in both . <br>
 <br>
if people were punished for there scams they cheat investors with then investing would not be considered gambling . <br>
 <br>
the managements of public companies have no interest in enriching there shareholders . <br>
 <br>
the game is fixed on the stock markets as it is at the casino&#039;s , and lottery tickets are even worse . <br>
 <br>
investing is a process of elimination , failure is the norm with public companies , all you need to do is look for the real gems , you don&#039;t need very many to be successful , just stay away from the scams . <br>
 <br>
just remember , there are more crooks outside of jails then inside .

</script><p> With gambling, all the value on the table is from the players minus the rake so on average, less value is being returned to the players then they put in.   The odds are also negative expectations so in the long run, you can only hope to lose.   With investing, you are investing in business operations which are hopefully generating a profit which is either being distributed to shareholders as dividends or being reinvested in the business thereby increasing the value of the shares.   There is more on the table than what was put in because the businesses generate a profit so on average, investors get more back then they put in.   With investing, the expectations are largely unknown and can only be guessed upon.   This affects the &quot;money management&quot; which is optimizing the geometric or logarithmic gains not the odds ( see St. Petersburg&#039;s Paradox ).   With negative expectations as in gambling, no amount of money management will help. <br>
 <br>
Poker is an odd beast as the expectation are too complex for most people to estimate and there is a psychologic factor.   Sometimes the expectations are in a player&#039;s favour and can be identified as such therefore it&#039;s a game where some money management can be a benefit.   Blackjack was also a game where the expectations would occasionally be positive allowing money management to be a benefit.   Card counting is a system for estimating when the expectations are in the player&#039;s favour.
        </p> When you&#039;re gambling you are not trading your money for anything. There is nothing to show for the money you have put up. When you make an investment there is generally something that is backing up your money. <br>
 <br>
It&#039;s similar to when a bank loans money to you and it&#039;s secured by a property. They are &quot;investing&quot; money in your property. There are different factors which are taken into consideration, like the value of the property and the borrower&#039;s ability to repay the loan. When gambling the money is all there is. Some activity is taking place and you&#039;re hoping that according to the rules of whatever game you&#039;re playing that you will obtain some immediate or almost immediate return. <br>
 <br>
When you gamble you are putting up money on an event. When you are investing you are usually putting up money for ownership in something. Sometimes that something increases in value or provides you with an income and sometimes it doesn&#039;t. <br>
 <br>
The big difference is that with most investments there is generally some way of obtaining information that will actually tell you about the investment and what the possibility there is for a return. The other thing is that usually an investment does not give you an immediate return. Gambling is usually about the immediate rather than long-term return. <br>
 <br>
Speculation is actually more like gambling. Speculation is when you put your money into something that is much riskier with the hope that there will be some kind of return.
        </p> Gambling is placing money on random chance. And simply exchanging money with other people say in poker. Investing in buying into a business which makes profit which you are (being an partial owner) entitled to.  <br>
 <br>
Investing is different to throwing money on the stock market without research. Is would obviously be relying on luck. Although even the most experience and well spread stock would still experience a loss, which cannot be controlled. The line that distinguishes the two is the nature of the system that the money is being put on. Completely random(gambling). Functioning business(stock).
        </p> The border is blurry and certainly many things that people on YA call investing are surely gambling.  For instance, binary options are just gambling.  There is absolutely nothing different between buying a binary option and betting the over/under on a football game.  Binary options are just cheesy ways that people open online gambling on stocks and get around gambling regulations.   <br>
 <br>
There is also &quot;investing&quot; that in one context really is investing and in another is gambling.  For instance, buying a gold futures call for most people is just gambling.  The expected return on the transaction is negative and there is no risk management justification or any other good justiification for doing it except &quot;I think gold is going to go up for [fill in stupid reason]&quot;.  Now if you are a jeweler and you know you need to buy a ton of gold at the expiration of the call, this is investing because you are controlling your costs and making your income stream steadier - worthy goals of investing. <br>
 <br>
Anyway, investing is differentiated from gambling not by skill - as you point out poker requires extreme skill to be good but we call it gambling.  Investing is deploying money so that your capital is doing something productive that ought to earn economic rent.  Examples of that are capitalizing the productions of goods and services, financing long-term govt projects like bridges and hospitals, taking on systematic risk for someone else who doesn&#039;t want it and will pay you to take on that risk, writing insurance policies, and similar productive deployments of capital.  Then there are the associated activities that do things like reduce risk and flatten out income streams from the core investing activities.  For instance, futures contracts are often used for gambling but if you own a ton of corporate bonds but want your return to be from corporate productivity not interest rate movements you can short T-note futures against your portfolio and that would be investing.  If you just believe interest rates are going up for yuor own personal dumb reason and short T-note futures, that&#039;s gambling. <br>
 <br>
Tons of the people on YA &quot;investing&quot; are just thinly disguised gamblers.  It&#039;s pretty easy to pick them out; questions like &quot;did you read the prospectus&quot;, &quot;did you look at the last 10-Q&quot;, &quot;do you know how that derivative works&quot;, &quot;etc separate the investors from the gamblers. <br>
 <br>
Edit: Another typical stupid Slick answer.  Yo Slick the notional size of all the derivatives contracts in the world is at least 50 times greater than the notional size of hard assets that you can invest in.  So I guess that all derivatives are just gambling according to your silly definition?
        </p> I would say that Poker is not really gambling though it is placed in that category usually. The best hand does not always win. A combination of strategy based on knowledge of the opponents gleaned from observation, the psychology of betting strategy making weak hands look strong and strong hands appear weak, elevates this form into almost investment status compared to games of chance that depend on nothing more than a roll of a dice, spin of a wheel or playing 2 cards with nothing you can do to increase your chances of winning. <br>
 <br>
Playing the stock market has investors and more than their share of gamblers. Gamblers because they do no investigation beyond rumour and reading media rags. Those that INVEST use their time into learning the craft, elevate their game to &quot;Poker&quot; status ...so to speak. :
        </p> Gambling is putting your money at stake and getting a reward only on chance.  Investing can require research and making a decision based on analysis and intuition.  I&#039;d say the line is research
        </p> Gambling is a subset of investing - to invest is to make educated gambles
