<h1>How can a 15 year old invest? Parents know NOTHING about money...at all. Who to call, what to do?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am 15 years old, and living in a lower middle class family. They withdraw money from the credit union once in a blue moon. My dad got frustrated, attempting to figure out how to invest for me, via internet. He knows NOTHING about money, but I REALLY want to invest. Is there anything I could do to invest? If there is ANYTHING I could do to simplify the process for my dad, so that he doesn&amp;#39;t get bored and give up, or if I could even invest independently, information would be greatly appreciated.
I&amp;#39;m looking for something long term, that needn&amp;#39;t necessarily produce big gains to begin with; bonds are up there too. But, I can&amp;#39;t make a CD account unless there are SUPER cheap CDs somewhere. My dad doesn&amp;#39;t make much, so we can&amp;#39;t afford to put too much down to begin with. I am just looking for relatively secure gains, that needn&amp;#39;t grow quickly, but wont ferment under a mattress somewhere. Thank you.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

Also, here&#039;s a simple way to buy stocks. Google General Electric Investor Relations, or Johnson and Johnson Investor relations. They will provide links on how you can start direct investment plans. I think both companies start their plans at $250. And you can send in checks to purchase additional shares when you have the money. Both of these stocks pay a dividend every three months, which means for every 1 share you own of Johnson and Johnson, you will receive 55 cents that you can either withdraw (bad idea), or reinvest to purchase more shares at no charge (good idea).  <br>
 <br>
That&#039;s a simple way to have your money working for you. <br>
 <br>
If you&#039;re looking for a CD, google ALLY Bank. You can start a CD direct from your own checking account by transferring. I have not used ALLY, but I use INGDIRECT***

</script><p> Well, I see you know that that you have ADHD and ODD. However, just because you have this awareness, doesn&#039;t give you a free pass to be rude to people and not try to control your emotions. That&#039;s not only disrespectful but lazy. And yes, you pretty much do have to do what your parents want you to do. You are not 18 and even if you were, respecting parents never stops. Despite your imbalances in your brain, you are old enough to start taking control of your actions and being held accountable. How do you think an officer of the law would have handled your attitude? I can tell you now, not very well. Let this grounding be a lesson to you for future references. The law and your bosses at work won&#039;t tolerate attitude. At 15, everything you are being taught now at home is preparing you for adulthood in a few years, and yes, it will be here before you know it. So if I were you, I would learn to start shaping up and getting myself under control right now.
        </p> I agree with Ben9999. Read books or online websites like The Motley Fool. The Fool website is also a community were you can read unbiased opinions of all kinds of stocks and other investments. You can also post questions that you might have. It is very useful. <br>
 Also Ben mentioned buying stocks direct and re-investing the dividends. These are called &quot;DRIP&quot;-Direct Re Investment Programs. They are very good to get into if you buy into a well established company. <br>
 Investopedia*** is another good rescource website for beginners.
        </p> As suggested above read up as much as you can on the stock market.  In addition to DRIP&#039;s by individual companies look into ING&#039;s Sharebuilder account.  You can buy fractional shares like a DRIP but have them all in a single account.  The $4 commission is not cheap, but reasonable as you learn. <br>
 <br>
Also check into NAIC investment clubs in your area.  ***betterinvesting.org.  There are some cities that have teenage clubs that have a mentor to help the team learn. <br>
 <br>
Good Luck!  You are wise to learn about the market when you are young.
