<h1>Investing money question?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am thinking of takin out a loan of about £5000 and investing it in something.

I want to invest in something that would be of high return or guaranteed return. 

Any ideas? im using 5000 as a sort of rough amount of money I could borrow easily and put into something.

 I am based in London UK

</script><p> please be very careful !  <br>

In almost all the books I read about investments, authors, who are very successful and disciplined traders, have made it clear, that borrowing money to make investments is NOT RECOMMENDED.  <br>
You can read very very famous books in the world of investment to get sure of that such as :  <br>
Technical analysis of the financial market &quot;Murphy&quot;  <br>
Trading for a Living &quot; Dr. A. Elder&quot;  <br>
Mastering the Trade &quot;Carter&quot;  <br>
Trading in the Zone &quot; Douglas&quot; <br>
How to make money in stocks &quot; O&#039;neil&quot; <br>
and ma nay many others. One of the reasons these traders mentioned &quot;and they tried it and failed&quot; is that investing what you don&#039;t own provoke psychological problems &quot;fear for example&quot;, which could facilitates meeting wrong decisions.  <br>
If you want to read more about that, pick one of those books &quot;or others&quot; and read first.  <br>
Anyway, if you insist, I would never recommend you to start with Gold, silver, oil, currency or any of the 24 hours markets , since these markets are usually the most difficult. Start with something easy, like stocks .
