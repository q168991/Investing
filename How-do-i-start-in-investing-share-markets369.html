</script><p> The very old saying Do not keep all your egg in one basket applies.  While investing keep following in mind. (1)  Safety   (2) Liquidity   In my opinion invest 20% in stock (speculation)  40% in medium term consistent  interest earning deposits (from well known  companies) ,  20% in long term investment and 20% in liquid asset (savings deposit, cash) to meet unforeseen exigencies.  <br>

</script><p> Are you able to invest in the global share market, or only in the Indian market? Start by going to the library and borrowing a basic book on stockmarket investing, such as one of the &quot;Idiot&#039;s ..&quot; or &quot;Dummies ...&quot; series of books. When you understand how the market works and know how to pick stocks based on fundamentals or technical analysis, then go to the financial section of newspapers and make your choice. Investing in the stock market is not a shortcut to wealth. Investing involves risk. The shares you buy can go up or down. Do not invest money you cannot afford to lose.
        </p> Investment is a simple concept which is often complicate too much by investors. Always &quot;keep it simple&quot; and be &quot;disciplined&quot; in investments. There are certain rules that needs to be followed while investing for a longer term. <br>
 <br>
1.Identify your short,medium and long term goals. <br>
 <br>
2. For Short and medium term goals(2-5), park your money in fixed income instruments and avoid going the equity route. <br>
 <br>
3. For long term goals (&gt;5 years), go for equity investing. <br>
 <br>
4. Keep it simple in equity investing. Go for good diversified mutual funds with good track record. <br>
 <br>
5.Ignore hot sectors or stocks which are being most talked about in televisions and newspapers. <br>
 <br>
6.Invest Regularly. Start a SIP(Systematic Investment Plan) in mutual funds to bring in discipline in your investments. <br>
 <br>
7.Execute &quot;Buy and Hold&quot; policy. Do not churn your investments often. <br>
 <br>
8. Last but not least, &quot;Start Early&quot;. <br>
 <br>
