</script><p> I agree with #1 in that it is smart to start.  <br>
 <br>
Hey, good on you by the way, firstly for having a thousand in the bank and secondly for being smart enough to ask questions. <br>
 <br>
I feel shares might be the way to go but like any investment, you need to understand what you are doing, protect your wealth from scams and crap advice and develop some streetwise smarts. <br>
 <br>
I would put the cash in a fixed deposit for a little while, earn a little bit of interest and build your understanding of investing in shares. You are obviously not a dill so it should not take long. Look at the ASX (Australian stock exchange) website for starters. It might be a little daunting but you need to learn the language. The ASX also has open days and courses, many of them free, so do it, learn and ask questions.   <br>
 <br>
While you are this age, a lot of seasoned investors will be very happy to help you with advice, find one or two. Ask friends, relatives, perhaps your parents lawyer, accountant or banker can steer you in the right direction. What you need is someone who has made a fortune in shares not just your average mum and dad investor. If you have no luck let me know, maybe I can help you find someone. <br>
 <br>
The key for you is to listen and learn and ask. You will set yourself up for life starting young and being clever about it. <br>
 <br>
Most of all, good luck and never ever give up. Investing is where it all happens. <br>
 <br>
Jackson.

</script><p> Advice from KIDD3422 seems reasonable enough. <br>
 <br>
Pennhope caught a real winner with Goog. <br>
 <br>
However, I want to advise caution for the short term, because it seems like a recession is upon us, and most stocks that did well over the past few years won&#039;t go right back up soon.   <br>
 <br>
A thousand dollars is not a lot of money, so you want to make sure you do the right thing with it, or you&#039;ll get discouraged and never invest again. <br>
 <br>
Beware of mutual funds that charge high fees. <br>
 <br>
Try to develop a plan, and stick with it. <br>
 <br>
Goog is around $600.00 a share, it started a few years ago at $85.00 a share. <br>
 <br>
That was one heck of a ride. <br>
 <br>
Most stocks will never do that.   <br>
 <br>
Best thing to do is open an account with a discount broker, and go about investing gradually. <br>
 <br>
Do like I did...buy some charting paper and begin doing charts on some companies that interest you. <br>
 <br>
My guess is that the future belongs to smaller type companies with little overhead that you hardly know about now. <br>
 <br>
Any company who can make a change needed to get everyone saving energy and less polluting of the environment most likely will be a good investment in the long run. <br>
 <br>
Your best investing is when you have a plan, and can stick to it come h+ll or high water.   <br>
 <br>
So, if you get a good paying job one day, then your employer should have a plan available to you which will not be heavy with fees. <br>
 <br>
High fees eat up any profits you may have.   <br>
 <br>
Having invested for well over twenty years now, I&#039;ve seen big gains and some severe losses. <br>
 <br>
Remember, there can still be an Enron out there that hasn&#039;t been discovered yet.   <br>
 <br>
Just be very careful and selective, and make sure you develop a plan that you can live with.
        </p> It&#039;s very smart to start investing young. Although if I were you, I&#039;d put my money into some no load mutual funds. They offer you better market exposure and spread out the risk between a bunch of different companies. Check out T Rowe Price, Vanguard, Dodge and Cox, and Fidelity.
        </p> The earlier response about investing in mutual funds was very good.  There is a radio program once a week that gives excellent advice on mutual funds.  It is sponsored by the Mutual Fund Store.  Even if you do not want to use their service, the show is worth listening to for information. <br>
 <br>
Check to see what station in your area brodcasts it.
        </p> Definately, becuase wen you&#039;re ready to go to college, the money will be built up. <br>
 <br>
From my bat mitzvah money 5 years ago, I invested in Google and Disney, you can&#039;t go wrong with those 2. <br>
 <br>
Also a smart company to invest in is Boeing.

        </p> I REALLY wish I had started investing looooong ago when I was 15.  <br>
I would be retired now at age 31. <br>
 <br>
Smart girl - do it !
