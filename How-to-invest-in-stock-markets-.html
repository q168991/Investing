</script><p> Learn before you invest or you will just lose all your money. ETF (Equity Traded Funds) are definitely not the smartest thing to start off with. Read &quot;The Intelligent Investor&quot; before you even think about trading stock. It also depends on which market do you want to get into. Basic stocks and ETFs probably Scottrade or E-Trade.

</script><p> Hi Suketh, it’s a good thing that you want to start investing early in stock market. You being a student, I would suggest you to invest a small amount till you get a good experience and grasp over the stock market. Alternatively, you can even consult a stock broker who will thoroughly guide you in your investment process. To start investing you need to have a pan card and other identity proof to open a demat account &amp; trading account at reputed stock brokers. Once these accounts are open then you can start investing, initially under the guidance of experts and later on by yourself.
        </p> If you are interested in learning the fundamentals of investing first you need to learn following things. <br>
 <br>
1. Learn Important Equities Rules <br>
2. You Need Expert Financial Advice <br>
3. Invest in Learning because Knowledge IS POWER <br>
4. Define YOUR Investing Objectives <br>
5. Invest NOW <br>
6. Do Not Play...Investing IS NOT a Joke!
        </p> Contact icici bank and open a online trading account. Have an account in the same bank and start trading. Look for small companies such as ashok leyland. Invest just 2,000 rupees in the beginning. Once the value of the share rises to Rs 10, sell your shares. Good luck.
        </p> then you go to share broker to open a d mat account brokers like geogit religare or sharekhan are famous or banks like icici direct or hdfc securities like that then get on line trading facility then you can start  <br>

 <br>
it is true you can earn good money if you do trading carefully at the same time you must be prepared  <br>
even if the entire money is lost you must be prepared  <br>
 <br>
then it will be comfortble for you if you atleast invest around 2 lakhs  <br>
 <br>

dr reddy&#039;s lab and pnb , then small shares lik cipla or ashok leyland etc watch their movements atleast for a month then you will have an idea when to purchase and when to sell
        </p> First of all. u have to have a DeMat account for investing in the stock markets. <br>
	Do know basics of stock markets. Once u hav finished. <br>
	Do stimulated/fake trading on moneybhai*** for practice U dont need demat account for that
        </p> 1) Register with a stockbroker or investment firm with ties to the Indian stock market. The defining factor when hiring financial assistance is experience with the market in which you invest your money. Stockbrokers can be costly, but they tend to respond quickly to queries about individual stocks. <br>

Examine the BSE 200 index to determine the strength of your investments in India. This index covers the 200 best-performing businesses in India on a daily basis. Look at individual businesses in your favored industrial sector to assess the wisdom of potential investments. <br>
 <br>

Go out on a limb with a technology stock through the BSE TECk index. The Indian economy features a rapidly expanding biotechnology and computer-development sector that has been a boon to investors. Past success should be taken with a grain of salt, however, because similar growth in the United States in the 1990s resulted in lost profits for investors. <br>
 <br>
4 <br>
Locate growing companies with small amounts of capital through the BSE Small-Cap Index. This index features hundreds of young companies with low funding that are looking for investors to take them to the next level. You can invest in a company at a cheap share price without a great deal of risk. <br>
