<h1>How would you invest $1K?</h1>

</script><p> If all you have is $1k and you cannot afford to lose it or need that money within 5 years it should not be in the stock market.  <br>
 <br>
Short term: <br>
30 day, 60 day FDIC insured CD&#039;s and auto rollover. Interest rates WILL go up in the future, and you don&#039;t want to be locked into any low rate investment over a long period of time.  <br>
 <br>
What to consider for long term: <br>
Roth IRA <br>
Dollar Cost Average in the S&amp;P 500 for the next 15-20 years. <br>
 <br>
If one thinks that at REIT today can pay over 30% of it&#039;s earnings in the form of a dividend, I&#039;ve got a rude awaking  that investor will face: A massive dividend cut. <br>
 <br>
Keep in mind that being a &quot;Top Contributor&quot; is not a qualification to be a &quot;financial expert.&quot;

</script><p> NOOOO!!! DO not invest 1K in stocks. Absolutely not. You will lose your money faster than you can say the word stock. Here&#039;s why: The commision fees that you will be charged will require you to make at least 30% increase per stock that you purchase. After all, placing all of $1K into oen stock is way too risky unless its a sure thing,. Your best bet is to purcahse a mutual fund that ou&#039;ve researched. This way, they do the work for you. Otherwise, wait till you have at least $5-10K. Then you will be well off into financial freedom.
        </p> It depends on your financial situation. <br>
 <br>
If you have revolving debt -- credit card, home equity loan, etc -- pay off the highest interest debt (or at least some of it.. with financial insecurity these days, having some cash on hand can be wise even with debt). <br>
 <br>
If your debt is under control, then think about what you need from savings.  Do you need it to be easily accessible for emergencies?  Do you have easily liquidated savings already for day to day issues and so don&#039;t need this amount to be as accessible for some time?   <br>
 <br>
If you need it to be available in case you might need it over the next year, then a savings account is probably your best bet.  You generally get next to nothing for interest unless it&#039;s a considerable sum -- usually $25k or more -- but you have no risk (look for a FDIC insured bank) and can access the money at any time with no penalty.   <br>
 <br>
If you don&#039;t need access to it for a long time, then a FDIC-insured CD is also safe and usually has higher interest paid to you; the catch is, you can&#039;t touch that money without losing ALL the interest and usually paying a penalty, until the duration of the CD is done.  The longer the term, the better the interest you earn.  If you know for sure you won&#039;t touch it for a year or more -- for example, a teen saving money for college in 3 years -- a CD can be a good option. <br>
 <br>
Stock is very volatile and thus very risky. You can get higher returns but you can also lose your shirt.  My father lost most of my college savings by what he thought was safe investing in the stock market -- it turned out that the stock he bought tanked and went from $10 a share to next to worthless in the three years I had until college.  It turned around and became decent again over time, but I needed that money in 3 years, not 10, and had already sold at the huge loss to get what we could when I needed it.  It generally is a reasonable investment for very long term funds that you have time and resources -- and knowledge -- to take well-judged risk with; retirement plans, for example (especially with company matching programs).
        </p> This question depends on how risky you are and how old you are. I am in college, and I invested 3k into the stock market and I made 50% already. <br>
 <br>
So for me, my answer is stock market and then maybe CD. These days...so little interest from savings account. It&#039;s probably true for the CD too.  <br>
 <br>

        </p> Binary options let users trade in currency pairs and stocks for various predetermined time-periods, minimal of which is 30 seconds. Executing trades is straightforward. The system uses user-friendly interfaces, which even an 8 years old kid, can operate without having to read any instructions. But winning trades is Not easy.  <br>
Binary trading is advertised as the only genuine system that lets users earn preposterous amounts of money in ridiculously short period of time. Advertisers try to implicate as if you can make $350 every 60 seconds; if it was true then binary trading would truly be an astonishing business.  <br>
However, does it make any sense? Can every trader make tons of money in binary trading? Who is actually paying all the money or the profit to traders?  <br>
The first challenge is finding a trustworthy binary broker; secondly, you need to find a binary trading strategy, which you can use to make profits consistently. Without an effective trading strategy, there is no way you can make money in this business. <br>
Learning a profitable trading strategy is possible, You should watch this presentation video https://tr.im/16635 <br>
It&#039;s probably the best way to learn how to win with binary option
        </p> You can&#039;t succed in binary trading without a strategy, a good method to follow and some kind of software support. They program I use is called &quot;Autobinary signals&quot;. It helps finding loopholes for guaranteed returns. It&#039;s very easy to use and I&#039;m earning good money. You find all the details on this site: http://tradingsignal.toptips.org
        </p> Seriously, you&#039;ll just lose it. Take a trip, buy something you enjoy, go to a course and that will be a better investment.
        </p> if you don&#039;t need the money any time soon <br>
 <br>
try a cd. <br>
 <br>
if money is needed next month try a savings account. <br>
 <br>
for long term investing try a roth ira. <br>
 <br>
good luck.

i have attended a lot of seminars, read counless books on forex trading and it all cost me thousands of dollars. the worst thing was i blew up my first account. after that i opened another account and the same thing happened again. i started to wonder why i couldn,t make any money in forex trading. at first i thought i knew everything about trading. finally i found that the main problem i have was i did not have the right mental in trading. as we know that psychology has great impact on our trading result. apart from psychology issue, there is another problem that we have to address. they are money management, market analysis, and entry/exit rules. to me money management is important in trading. i opened another account and start to trade profitably after i learnt from my past mistake. i don&#039;t trade emotionally anymore.  <br>
if you are serious about trading you need to address your weakness and try to fix it. no forex guru can make you Professional trader unless you want to learn from your mistake.
        </p> I&#039;d enter the stock market and buy 100 shares in The Macerich Company (MAC), it&#039;s quarterly dividends add up to 33% return per year.
