<h1>Right now which sector is it best to invest my money?</h1>
<div class="answer">I have about $500 that I can invest and I was wondering which sector(s) should I be investing in? I am not looking for like a get rich quick scheme ( though we all can agree that would be nice) but to make some return over the next couple of months, and maybe* year.

I also have limited knowledge about this.

But yea which sector would you reccommend? Energy? mining ? etc?<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Believe it or not, people are (typical of people) afraid of the economy, which has given much rise to the value of gold. Just about a month or two ago, the value of one share in an amount of gold went from around a couple hundred of dollars to $1k+. A lot of people just made thousands of dollars in the gold sector. <br>
 <br>
All in all, precious metals (gold, etc.) are a good thing to invest in right now. <br>
 <br>
I hope this helps!

</script><p> I am not clear exactly as to how you propose to invest your money. <br>
Trough a broker or on you own? <br>
Any way If you desire to be on your own than may I suggest SCOTTRADE.COM <br>
You can open a trading account for $500 and start buy and sell immediately.It will cost you $7 to buy and $7 to sell no other charges period. <br>
Go to their site read the documentation and get started. <br>
Energy would be a good sector to try. <br>
Personally I buy and sell Googl stock. You need to know what you&#039;re doing and even then there are no guarantees.But it is fun .DO IT!! <br>
By the way in case you wanted to know how to make a million dollars in the stock market, <br>
Simply start with two. <br>
m.k.
        </p> So they can take over one sixth of the economy through direct regulation and laws. Then the full power of centralized government will then possess a monopoly over a very vital service industry that every American wants and needs. The power can then be used by these less than 600 people to control over 300 million people. That&#039;s why. And you know what? That will happen in 2014. Comforting, huh?
        </p> what if your money made you 1 - 10% or 10% to 200% per month <br>
with no risk at all,what if you dont need to work and just enjoy life <br>
what if you can watch your wealth growing while you are having fun <br>
