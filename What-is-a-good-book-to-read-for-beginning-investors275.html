<h1>What is a good book to read for beginning investors?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am a new investor and I know some of the basics- such as what a stock, mutual fund, ETF, etc... is.  But I want to learn more about it and figure out how to really become a good investor- and not just look for whatever Morningstar rates as a 5-star stock as something I would be interested in investing in.  And more than that- how to choose between two stocks that look very similar (besides the obvious- risk and fees).  Can anyone suggest a good book that can help me learn more about how to invest or what I should be looking at when doing my homework on these stocks/funds???  Thank you much-<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Beating the street by Peter Lynch or The liittle blue book that beats the market by Greenblatt.  Still, there are so many other ones out there - hard to know where to start (hey go read the Bershire Hathaway annual reports too). <br>
 <br>
Also, Reminiscences of a Stock Operator by Lefevre but this one is really old and somewhat dated for info - more just a really interesting book.
        </p> Get a copy of Handbook fro Stock Investors by Goh Kheng Chuan.
        </p> The ABSOLUTE best book to read is Robert Kiosaki&#039;s book &quot;Cash Flow Quadrant&quot; from the Rich Dad series of books.  I wish I read that book BEFORE every other investment book/video/course - and I am an avid reader, and have read thousands.  Start here, then add the others. <br>
