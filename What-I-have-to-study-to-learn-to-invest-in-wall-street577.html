<h1>What I have to study to learn to invest in wall street?</h1>
<div class="answer">I don&amp;#39;t really know If I wanna be a broker or an entrepreneur of my own company. So I wanna study a career that will let me to invest as a broker, or invest while I&amp;#39;m an entrepreneur of my own CO. but not such a broker officially. This second one just invest with my own resources, as any other person.

</script><p> Being a broker is not investing.  A broker is a salesman.  They make their money by taking commissions and fees from their customers.  They accept these commissions even when they&#039;re wrong. <br>
 <br>
If you want to be successful as an investor you have to know more than the average person.  So read.  Get boos and keep up with the market pages of the Wall Street Journal (print or online doesn&#039;t matter&#039;)

</script><p> I would say talk to an actual wall street investor and they can inform you how things work . Because if you go to school for it then the school is gona teach you black and white about wall street investment but if you talk to an actual investor they can give you methods that the school didnt teach  and give you tips.
        </p> Grab your keys and go to your bookstore. <br>
There are many great books that will teach you how to invest like a pro. <br>
Your library may also have some good investment books. <br>
Investing is self-taught.  No school can really teach you. <br>

        </p> it is dirty job.
