<h1>Help first time investing money?</h1>
<div class="answer">I am a college student and getting a job this summer to help pay for school.  I really wanted to invest some money, but I have no idea what to do, where to put my money, or even how to get started!  I need money for school most importantly, so I can only put a few hundred (if that) into this.  Any advice or tips on where to begin would be really appreciated!!

Thanks :)<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

I blew $20,000 that I saved up in my early teenage years; first I invested in quasi-penny stocks, which are stocks that more often than not involve white collar criminals and sham companies. Then, two years later I thought hey I&#039;m more mature and intelligent, maybe the first time was necessary learning; after all, penny stocks ?! I must have been stupid to survive for a little while when I was so naive, but now I&#039;m clever and I know to invest in mid-large cap corporations, and also, I can hedge my risk. I traded options, which are derivatives based on underlying assets; in essence, they magnify price movements in the shares such that you can earn 20% ROI in a day. Right, so I actually experienced tremendous success and almost doubled my money through a combination of luck and obsessive analysis, until of course the market starting bucking and heaving. The funny thing is, you can make money when the market is in a downtrend, so I actually adapted and learned the ins and outs of making contradictory bets; there are countless &quot;strategies&quot; which involve betting to mitigate risk, and it basically allows you to keep your options open. Theoretically, you are supposed to exploit esoteric discrepancies, but you must count on the market being the least bit rational. You cannot count on the market, as the extreme volatility and hysteria following the collapse of Lehman illustrated. Count on the unexpected, because history is not going to answer for the unprecedented. The possibility is small, rare even, but you can lose it all through factors that are not in your control. You don&#039;t want to toil and sweat at some shitty summer job, only to find out that you did it for nothing. We do not know if we are witnessing the beginning of a nascent historical curiosity. We have no perspective. To your question, $1000 is nothing as investing goes. The most ambitious men can reliably make 15% returns, using devious strategies (look up &#039;hedge fund&#039; for more). So, at best you can make $150 gross in one year; if that is trading gains, you&#039;ll be lucky to take home $100. The extra stress and frantic worrying will exact a toll on your health, and your energy will be sapped. Demoralized, you will realize that if you had worked an extra 8-12 hours, you could have earned that $100 the right way.  <br>
 <br>
It&#039;s good that you have acumen to care about personal finance at this point, but the best advice is to save your money and continuously save; the vast majority of millionaires and multi-millionaires have made money by saving relentlessly and pouncing on a few reasonable opportunities. But though it&#039;s not advisable to cast your stones just yet, you can always make the best risk free investment and study how people have failed before you, so you don&#039;t fail the same way; just as well, you should investigate the people who have succeeded beyond the vision of doubters.

</script><p> Thw way to go is with an index mutual fund or ETF since most managed Portfolio managers can&#039;t beat the market.  Read A random walk down Wall Street.  One of the best investments id Vanguard&#039;s Total Stock Market Index which invests in NASDAQ, New York Stock Exchange and the American stock exchange.   <br>
 <br>
If you wanted more diversity instead pick the Vanguard World Stock ETF which would also include USA, Asia, Canada, Emerging Markets and Latin America. Good luck!
        </p> Don&#039;t do the stock market. <br>
No company will take you with just a couple of hundred. <br>
 <br>
Keep the money SAFE in a checking account with some on the side in a savings account. <br>
Tie them together at your bank so you can move money from one to the other. <br>

        </p> You need to open a &quot;trading account&quot; with a share/stock broker in India. This will be used to place buy and sell orders of shares on your name. You need to open a &quot;demat account&quot; with the same share broker ( for sake of easy and effortless linked operations) or any other agency ( like banks ) to keep the shares you will purchase. You need money. This will be through your bank account. You must submit account opening forms and relevant documents to the broker. And when everything is in order, you simply place buy and sell orders. In case you need more information, please email me. Am in the same field for a long time and based in Mumbai - the Financial capital of India!

        </p> You have no idea what you&#039;re doing, take the time to learn before doing so. People make money from you losing money. It is a shark tank and you can lose a lot if you cannot swim.
