</script><p> In short, a lot of investing is in stocks and bonds - but there are other things as well. Think of owning stocks as owning small slices of a company. Bonds are you lending a government or company your money and they give you periodic payments for it. <br>
 If you are interested, you need to think long term, avoid greed and panic, and know your investment goals, risk tolerance, and  time horizon. More risk means more reward, but many go too far and lose their shirts. <br>
 Try reading Investing For Dummies for a good starter book. You can probably find it in your library.

</script><p> Your question is way too general to answer here, the answer will fill a book.  SO.....  head for your local library and read several books on investing.  Investing for Dummies and Mutual Funds for Dummies may be a good start.  Also read books by Peter Lynch.
        </p> Read &quot;real money - sane investing in an insane world&quot;.  Great book to teach you about investing.
        </p> Honestly it depends in what you are looking to invest in? Try little things first
