</script><p> Start by learning a bit on how the stock market work, portfolios and investing as a game. <br>
I personally like trading in foreign exchange and money markets rather than stock, check out the site and they have a learning program with play money you invest as your own broker and check out your results. http://***fxcmtr***/ <br>
There are such sites for stock markets that will allow you to choose a portfolio, invest play money and simulate your results. <br>
How much to invest? Small - Mutual funds, investment funds or the sites I tell you. Medium - Do one part yourself and get a broker. Large - Broker following your instructions. <br>
Never put all eggs in one basket... check out all options and put some money in each, 20% can be high risk-high return and the rest moderate to conservative.

</script><p> Hi Cara <br>
 <br>
You don&#039;t want to jump blindly into investing. I would recommend doing some research and find a trusted advisor to help you get started. The most important thing about investing is knowing and understanding the risks involved with investing, and of course finding the securities you want to invest in.  <br>
 <br>
Once you know that, opening an online brokerage account is fairly easy and quick. It&#039;s similar to opening a bank account, but often you can take care of most or all of it via the Internet. You can usually begin trading as soon as your account has been properly funded (check with each broker for their specific policies).  <br>
 <br>
As an example, Scottrade only requires a $500 minimum to open a new account, and you can apply online. They have a flat rate ($7) for most online market and limit equity orders, regardless of your trade frequency, account balance, or the number of shares in a transaction. <br>
 <br>
You can compare the commissions/fees of several brokerage firms at: http://***scottrade***/online_broker_c... . <br>
 <br>
Good luck investing!  <br>

        </p> The smartest thing is to put your available funds into at least 6 different types of shares. Some experts recommend you should put money in nearly 20 different shares to diversify safely. Spread your investments into totally unrelated sectors, e.g. banking and IT. This ensures if one sector fails to deliver results, you can earn decent returns from the others. <br>
 <br>
You should not only diversify across the different sectors of the stock market but also into other investment avenues till you develop confidence in the stock market. An intelligent investor will use some portion of their investment money and invest it in secure investments like bonds and bank deposits though they provide less interest.
        </p> To be begin with open a cds/brokerage account/cd account with a stock broker. Its like a bank account. Everytime you buy/sell a stock, they record it there.Then do your research well into the company you want to invest in. Dont invest in a company that will flop in 10 years time ( remember Enron?). Warren Buffet, the world&#039;s best Value Investor says, if you cant invest in it for 10 years, then dont invest in it for 10 minutes. Ensure that , the company posses these qualities. <br>
1. Great Management <br>
2. Great Moat/Monopoly/ They are huge <br>
3. Great Margin of Safety (buy when cheap) <br>
4. Great Meaning, do you love the company, use their goods/products. <br>
5. Great oops! have briefly forgotten! I&#039;ll remember later
        </p> There are great no load mutual funds out there such as Fidelity, Vanguard, Janus etc...  <br>
 <br>
Go to Fidelity***, Vanguard*** or Janus***. Let the pros pick the stocks for you since you are new to this. Be sure to assess your risk tolerance before you invest. If you are young you can be a bit more aggressive with risk. Visit investopedia*** if you want to learn more about the basics of investing and terms such as risk tolerance. <br>
 <br>
Best of luck.
        </p> Many on-line brokers have paper trading accounts that mimic the market, then you wont lose money while you learn. Options express and Preferred Trade are a couple that come to mind.  <br>
I would suggest you read a lot. Or even volunteer at a full service broker, letting them know you will do filing or typing or whatever, if a broker will take you under his wing to teach you the ropes.  <br>
Hope this helps. <br>
Happy Trading!
        </p> Read about investing.  I have a free downloadable book on retirement investing from my website.  It focuses on retirement investing, but you will pick up general investing info.  Click on my profile and read the info to find the address for this site, or email me. <br>
 <br>
Two good books on investing are Investing for Dummies and Mutual Funds for Dummies.  That is where I started when I was new.
        </p> Mutual Funds....call Fidelity Investments or go to ***fidelity***
        </p> you must invest in education first, you can do courses or buy investing books. after you have enough knowledge then you can start to invest.
        </p> Call a stock broker.
