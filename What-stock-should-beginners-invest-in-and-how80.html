</script><p> (1) Its better if you don&#039;t know much about investing to go with a mutual fund.  They have professional managers to run them.  <br>
(2) Stocks won&#039;t have a PE ratio if they aren&#039;t making a profit.  EPS or earnings per share, need to be positive.  Also there won&#039;t be a dividend yield if they don&#039;t pay one.  That is very typical of speculative or growth stocks. <br>
(3) You can never fully know if something will be successful. <br>
(4) You need to start with enough and give enough time for growth to offset any transactions fees. <br>
(5) You need to own at least 7 different stocks in different industries to be diversified, or get one mutual fund.  A mutual fund can be broke up of different stocks, domestic and international, bonds, currency, and commodities.

 <br>
1) I would not ask you to jump into investing right from Day 1. Since you are starting out with investing, try and learn the basics of investing, when, why and how? demand-supply deals, I wont name any stocks for you friend, all i would say is, dont ask anyone for advice on what to buy and what to sell. It will get you into trouble. The world is full of 100 intelligent people who will give you 100 best stocks, so make the study yourself and work on it.  <br>
 <br>
2)I am quite bad with Fundamental Analysis, so I cant help you on that. <br>
 <br>
3)Two ways - Fundamental Analysis and Technical Analysis. You will need to google that! See, its not a way to find out which stock will be successful but you sure can identify trends and pick out good buys. I use the latter. <br>
 <br>
4) How much should you invest? Its simple! Invest only the sum which you are prepared to loose, don&#039;t pump in all your savings.  <br>
 <br>
5) Commodities are the best deal if you are looking to diversify your portfolio. And Gold is the real deal here.  <br>
 <br>
And yeah, read, read as much as you can. Give the thing your time, Investing is an art, you need practice before you can master it, though no one has mastered it. A trader or investor has to make losses as he starts off, thats how he learns and makes money. So be prepared for it.  <br>
 <br>
Good Luck! <br>

Open up a portfolio without using real money. You can give yourself as much or as little money to try out the market. The stocks you want to focus on is consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and healthcare. These are DEFENSIVE stocks that will survive through good and bad times. Most of my positions are in these stocks. Some names include 3M, Procter &amp; Gamble, Kimberly Clark, Exxon Mobil, Walmart, Costco. Everybody&#039;s got to eat and wipe their butts regardless of the state of economy. Many of these companies survived through the Great Depression. <br>
 <br>
That&#039;s the benefits. You can sleep at night knowing your money is doing well. There are NO guarantees that you won&#039;t lose money. It&#039;s just that these stocks are the best. They pay good dividends too. <br>
 <br>
Then once you&#039;re comfortable and test the waters of the market, you can finally put some real money in. Go to Scottrade***. They&#039;re excellent for beginners. <br>
 <br>
If you&#039;re new to stocks, DON&#039;T DAY TRADE. You&#039;ll a rookie in a world of professionals. I tried day-trading with Citigroup and AIG when they were a little bit over $1. I had some luck at first, making about $30 a day but I was way over my head. My luck didn&#039;t last long and I had to rethink my strategy. <br>
 <br>
Day trading involves A LOT of commissions to the broker. With all the commissions deducted from each trade, you&#039;ll be lucky if you only lose half your money. <br>
 <br>
I would just day trade using Yahoo! Finance. Open a stimulation account, give yourself $100 worth of fake money and play it in the stimulation format. You&#039;ll see what I mean by losing money every easily. <br>
 <br>
Good luck.
        </p> To begin with I am only going to answer the questions I feel I can give you advice on and I have provided the number to the question I have answered.  <br>
 <br>
1. The best stocks for beginners are going to be ones that are fairly stable. As far as how I would suggest trying to find a stock broker who may even be able to answer some of these questions better than I can. <br>
 <br>
3.It is very hard to tell whether a stock will be successful or not, your best bet is to find ones that are fairly stable. I am not sure which companies are good in the UK, but I know in the U.S. that stocks such as Walmart and McDonald&#039;s are usually stable.
        </p> Here you will find a step by step guide which will hopefully give you a better and deeper insight into how it is possible for you to make money from Binary Options trading https://tr.im/vmFMh <br>
 <br>
You will first need to know what exactly Binary Options trading is, whilst this may seem like common sense many people just have a vague idea of what is involved and the exact risks attached to any trade, so make sure you fully understand the difference for example between actually buying a fixed asset and trading in Binary Options as the two could not be more different. <br>
 <br>
Next you will need to become something of an investigative journalist when you start trading in Binary Options and by this we mean you need to have a nose for a news story that is going to have a dramatic effect on whatever it is you intend to trade, and one way for you to do this is to keep fully abreast of all the daily financial news stories as this is the only way you are going to be able to make an informed decision on the movement of any Binary Options you are trading.
        </p> 1. public utilities or a stock called MKL <br>
2. if it doesn&#039;t show yields, never buy it. <br>
3. read Intelligent Investor for methods, too many too explain, but mostly look at p/e ratios of many years and long term earnings stability. also look at assets compared to liabilities <br>
4. start with 600 <br>
5. invest in 3-4 or so companies that you understand and you know that they make a profit. Fool*** is a good source for stock choices.
        </p> Binary options let users trade in currency pairs and stocks for various predetermined time-periods, minimal of which is 30 seconds. Executing trades is straightforward. The system uses user-friendly interfaces, which even an 8 years old kid, can operate without having to read any instructions. But winning trades is Not easy.  <br>
Binary trading is advertised as the only genuine system that lets users earn preposterous amounts of money in ridiculously short period of time. Advertisers try to implicate as if you can make $350 every 60 seconds; if it was true then binary trading would truly be an astonishing business.  <br>
However, does it make any sense? Can every trader make tons of money in binary trading? Who is actually paying all the money or the profit to traders?  <br>
The first challenge is finding a trustworthy binary broker; secondly, you need to find a binary trading strategy, which you can use to make profits consistently. Without an effective trading strategy, there is no way you can make money in this business. <br>
Learning a profitable trading strategy is possible, You should watch this presentation video https://tr.im/03f02 <br>
It&#039;s probably the best way to learn how to win with binary option
        </p> The price and value of investments and their income fluctuates: you may get back less than the amount you invested. Remember that how an investment performed in the past is not a guide to how it will perform in the future. If you are in any doubt about investing in these types of investments, you should consult a financial adviser. <br>
 <br>
remember the above before you invest only invest in what you can afford to loose <br>
 <br>
do plenty reasearch get a book on investing read it then reasearch companies then invest
        </p> If you&#039;re new to stock markets that you should only trade FTSE100 companies as it represents 100 biggest UK companies and thus they are the safest option. <br>
As you have £500-£1000 share dealing might not be for you as need much more money to make a decent profit you should consider financial spread betting and CFD trading.
        </p> I believe utilities to be a good long term investment. While the share price will go up and down the interest is quite good. Beside&#039;s everbody uses energy. Oil, Gas, Electric. You could even speculate on the smaller oil companies, some of which are classed as penny shares.  <br>
Good luck. By the way if you find something stupendous, please share it.

i have attended a lot of seminars, read counless books on forex trading and it all cost me thousands of dollars. the worst thing was i blew up my first account. after that i opened another account and the same thing happened again. i started to wonder why i couldn,t make any money in forex trading. at first i thought i knew everything about trading. finally i found that the main problem i have was i did not have the right mental in trading. as we know that psychology has great impact on our trading result. apart from psychology issue, there is another problem that we have to address. they are money management, market analysis, and entry/exit rules. to me money management is important in trading. i opened another account and start to trade profitably after i learnt from my past mistake. i don&#039;t trade emotionally anymore.  <br>
if you are serious about trading you need to address your weakness and try to fix it. no forex guru can make you Professional trader unless you want to learn from your mistake.
