<div class="answer">I need to start a portfolio but I have no clue where to begin. I&amp;#39;m afraid to talk to a consultant because of my investing ignorance. Please tell me the basics of investing starting with what a yield and return are.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> yield typically pertains to the percentage dividend that might be received for owning a stock. <br>
 <br>
own shares of stock is actually owning a piece of a company. <br>
 <br>
companies typically sell shares of stock to raise money. <br>
 <br>
so when you buy stock, you are buying a fractional ownership in that company. <br>
 <br>
at times the company will return some of its earnings back to shareholders in the form of dividends.  the yield would be the amount of the dividend divided by the cost of the share.  Much like the interest you receive on your savings account at the bank, the dividend yield represents your return on your investment.

</script><p> You should spend some on your investment education first. Investing for Dummies might actually be a good place to start. An excellent choice is &quot;How to Make Money in Stocks&quot; by O&#039;Neil. Next read &quot;Investors Corner&quot; on Investors*** every day. For a small time investment you will reap huge rewards.  When you get more advanced, learn and understand what &quot;Money Management&quot; means. Search Yahoo! for the term &quot;turtle trader&quot; for clues. One last book to put on your shelf, &quot;The New Market Wizards&quot; by Schwager. It&#039;s filled will interviews of the most successful investors in the world, and how they succeed. Last but not least, Yahoo! Finance is a first rate website for all kinds of investment information. p.s. buffalocrossing is right, investopedia*** is first rate.
        </p> Investing for Dummies would be very helpful.  Plenty of guides on the web also-- <br>

THERE&#039;S SOMETHING ABOUT having money that makes people do incredibly foolish things with it. <br>
 <br>
Think of it as the investment version of the &quot;wealth effect&quot;: Uncomfortable with savings and hesitant to sit on cash, many people insist on putting 100% of their assets to work, and not a penny less. This constant need to be invested prompts them to make investment decisions for exactly the wrong reasons. <br>
 <br>
Without a doubt, the most idiotic reason to make an investment is for fun. Whenever I hear people draw a distinction between their investments and their &quot;fun money,&quot; I can&#039;t help but feel a bit nauseated. <br>
 <br>
No matter if you&#039;ve got millions or just a few grand, the fun of investing is making money. Putting assets to work for giggles or amusement is akin to throwing cash down the drain. Why do it?
        </p> I have thought about this and the first thing I would NOT do is broadcast that I won the lottery. I would very quietly do what I needed to do to claim the winnings (via attorney etc.) and hire someone to help me wisely manage the funds. Then I would take care of my immediate family...quietly and discreetly. I would give to my favorite charities and causes in the same way. If you have someone helping you manage and grow your money you should be able to hang on to it so you can continue to benefit others as you wish. It&#039;s about discipline and investment. I think most lottery winners go broke because they start living the lifestyles of the rich and famous without being prudent about investment or spending. I suppose being too generous plays a part in this as well. I think the key is to keep it quiet and have someone help you manage the money.
