<h1>Investing for short term?</h1>
<div class="answer">I want to invest 50 lacs for a short term of 6 months. I am an NRI and will be returning to India in 6 months. Any suggestions? Also please suggest keeping in mind the tax angle.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> Investing short term is highly risky. you may loose your money. only thing i would recommend is fixed deposit for 1 year and you will get 7-8% interest which is good and safe. investments short term are highly unpredictable. Do not buy stocks for 6 months chances are that you will lose money. even if you gain little bit you have to pay high taxes.  <br>
 <br>
 <br>
Good luck.  <br>
 <br>
and for above 50 lacks = $100000 if dollar is 50 rupees.

</script><p> The amount can be invested in an nre account fixed deposit. There are no taxes on income. You can earn a tax free income of 8.5% plus. If you already dont have an account, it can be opened with any Indian bank easily.  <br>
 <br>
If you like to assume more risk, you can opt to invest in shares or mutual funds. However, the markets have recently moved up, so it would a risky proposition to invest at this juncture.  <br>
 <br>
Thanks
        </p> there are no ensures and the terrific investment of overdue has been components. How approximately paying for a flat and letting it out. Even in six/12 months you&#039;re able to have made some thing. Or purchase land, with the vogue for brand spanking new properties, this shoudl circulate up. yet of course purchase land sensibly, might you reside there?
        </p> What is 50 lacs?  If 50 lacs means 50 rupees, that&#039;s not even enough for a coffee at the McDonald&#039;s.

        </p> fixed  deposit is the best option. interest from fixed deposit is taxable. <br>
you can also invest in debt mutual fund, if the investment is above one year,no need to pay any tax <br>
