<h1>Any good books on investing?</h1>
<div class="answer">I just went to the book store to pick up a book on investing (stocks, mutual funds for the long term or any general knowledge as I am a newbie). I noticed that there are a lot of books out there.

I know it takes discipline, time and research to invest properly. So I just want some knowledge to make some proper decisions in the future when I am ready.

I wanted to know what you guys out there read and recommend.

Thanks!<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> I think the best book is &quot;The Little Book that Beats the Market&quot; by Joel Greenblatt.  This is a book on value investing that discusses the 2 most important criteria for picking stocks: low PE and high return-on-capital.  There is a website that has stocks that meet his criteria: ***magicformulainvesting*** <br>
 <br>
The following is a portfolio of stocks that currently meet his criteria: <br>
