</script><p> If you&#039;re a rookie in investing or stocks, go to <br>
 <br>
***finance.yahoo***. <br>
 <br>
Open up a portfolio without using real money. You can give yourself as much or as little money to try out the market. The stocks you want to focus on is consumer staples, consumer discretionary, and healthcare. These are DEFENSIVE stocks that will survive through good and bad times. Most of my positions are in these stocks. Some names include 3M, Procter &amp; Gamble, Kimberly Clark, Exxon Mobil, Walmart, Costco. Everybody&#039;s got to eat and wipe their butts regardless of the state of economy. Many of these companies survived through the Great Depression. <br>
 <br>
That&#039;s the benefits. You can sleep at night knowing your money is doing well. There are NO guarantees that you won&#039;t lose money. It&#039;s just that these stocks are the best. They pay good dividends too. <br>
 <br>
Then once you&#039;re comfortable and test the waters of the market, you can finally put some real money in. Go to Scottrade***. They&#039;re excellent for beginners.

</script><p> Practicing without risking money is the best and fastest way to learn the stock market. Find yourself a virtual trading site, register and give a go. The website issues you virtual money and you invest it. It&#039;s a great way to make mistakes and develop an investing style that works for you. <br>
 <br>
As far as the best trading site-- depends on the type of trading you&#039;re going to do and how much money you expect to have in the account. Some online brokers require a minimum balance -- like Etrade-- or they charge you a fee. But, if you&#039;re going to invest in high risk penny stocks, ETrade has the widest selection. <br>
 <br>
Before you register, figure out what you need. No fees, good service and tools, penny stocks, mutual funds, advice, etc.
        </p> You can always set up a fake portfolio on Yahoo finance... If you actually want to set up a real account go to Tradeking or Scottrade. Also as a bit of general advice I recommend investing in exchange traded funds (ETFs) unless you find the market fascinating and have a lot of time to do research. These allow you to own a little stock in a lot of companies and reduce the risk that you&#039;ll pick a bad investment. Two examples are the SPDR fund (SPY) and the iShares fund (IVV).
        </p> To learn about technical trading, I use Trader Bots to help me with my trading decisions http://***traderbots*** <br>
 <br>
I like Etrade for trading, but people say scottstrade is good too. <br>
 <br>
good luck.
