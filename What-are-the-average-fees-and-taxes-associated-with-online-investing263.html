<h1>What are the average fees and taxes associated with online investing?</h1>
<div class="answer">I was planning on investing online with either ING Direct, Scott Trade, or E-Trade. Is one better than the other? What types of fees and comissions should I be planned to pay? What is the rate and how often will I be taxed? From my current understanding, I would only be eligible to pay taxes on money that I took out of the market. If I keep the money in the market, and/or moved it around to other stocks, am I taxed? As to my situation, I am 20 years old, and already have a rental property. I did recieve a large amount of money from a recent inheritance and do have some invested by a broker, as well as in bonds. I want to see how well I can do myself, and learn about the market. I have long term investment goals, and don&amp;#39;t plan to make a quick buck, but would also be interested in learning how to do that as well. Thank you in advance for any advice you may have.<p><script async src="//pagead2.googlesyndication.com/pagead/js/adsbygoogle.js"></script>

</script><p> fees and commissions - With discount online brokers expect to pay from $0 (some give you 100 free trades to sign up) to about $12.95 (T. Rowe Price, Vanguard).  E-Trade is in financial difficultly.  Make sure they won&#039;t charge you an account inactivity fee each quarter you don&#039;t make trades.  A good way to increase you nest egg over the long term is to buy dividend paying stocks and reinvest those dividends.  Most brokers will do this for you for free.  Scottrade won&#039;t, which is why I don&#039;t like them.  Look at Schwab, they are a few dollars more per trade but in my opinion, they are worth it for their research.   <br>
Rate and frequency of taxes.  For stocks you sell within one year of purchase, you are taxed at your regular earned income tax rate (short term capital gains).  For stocks you sell after one year of purchase (long term capital gains) the max rate is now 15%.  The President wants that to increase to 20%.  With &quot;a large amount of money from a recent inheritance&quot; depending on the amount of dividends, capital gains, and earned income you receive, you may have to pay &quot;estimated taxes&quot; 4 time a year, each quarter.  Hire a tax accountant for more details.   <br>
You pay taxes on dividends, bond interest, and profits (capital gains) from stock sells in the year you received the money.  Even if dividends and interest are reinvested, and capital gains are &quot;immediately&quot; used to buy another stock, the IRS says you have taken the money out of the market (yes, even for one second) so therefore you owe taxes on them. <br>
As to your last question, how to make a quick buck - a trip to Vegas (or nowadays) any of the hundreds of gambling (politely called gaming) sites aboard river boats, in Indian reservations and in Atlantic City and horse, dog tracks around the country.  The stock market is not a good way to do it.
