</script><p> Depends on what you already know.  We&#039;ll assume that you&#039;re beginning. <br>
 <br>
A good primer is How to Make Money in Stocks by William O&#039;Neil. <br>
 <br>
Another good one is one of Jim Cramer&#039;s books. <br>
 <br>
But books will only get you so far. At some point, you&#039;ll also want to get at least a little training. <br>
 <br>
For free, you can start by visiting thestreet***. That&#039;ll get you a pretty good primer so at least you&#039;ll understand what the markets are and what a stock is, etc. If you get a chance, watch Mad Money on CNBC. Don&#039;t trade any of his picks. Just use the show to get you to understand some basics and get a feel for the market itself. <br>
 <br>
Once you understand stocks, go to 88options***. It&#039;s a website that&#039;ll help you understand options (what they do, how they work, etc). You don&#039;t need to trade them, but the more you know, the more you&#039;ll see how options can really be the safest way to invest (once you&#039;re educated). <br>
 <br>
Next, subscribe to something like investorsbusiness daily or something like that that can help you identify good stocks. <br>
 <br>
As you get more advanced, you might want a technical analysis book like Murphy&#039;s Visual Investor or A Technical Analysis Course by Meyer. <br>
 <br>
If it&#039;s discipline, probably Trading in the Zone by Mark Douglas or Mastering the Trade John Carter <br>
 <br>
If you have any questions, please let me know.  <br>
 <br>
Hope this helps!

</script><p> One thing you need to know is how much of a risk taker are you?  If the stock price suddenly drops, will you lose sleep? <br>
 <br>
If you are more conservative, then buy shares of Boeing or Procter &amp; Gamble.  These companies are stable and should be around awhile.  If you want high dividends, then invest in a utility company. <br>
 <br>
Some people prefer to invest in mutual funds because what you end up doing is invest in a whole bunch of different companies.  Investing in mutual funds is a way to spread out the risk. <br>
 <br>
If you like risk, then invest in biotech, solar energy companies, technology or telecommunications.
        </p> The stock market has become a bag of hot air in the form of futures and speculations. It is not based on anythig real anymore. It serves little purpose now other than &quot;LONG TERM&quot; investment or a avenue for players to trade &quot;inside&quot; What this bag of air has done most efrficiently in recent years is cost thousands of Americans their jobs. Why? Because a company can be &quot;worth&quot; more if it outsources to cheap labor markets..so in the end of the day money has become more important than people in this country...Invest in a individual retirement acct.
        </p> What do you like?  What businesses inspire you?  What company can you see getting big and bigger?  If you like WalMart, think of it, if you like Target better, think of them, if you like donuts and the new Duncan Donut store or Krispy Kreme impresses you--these are the things to check out.  If you thing the wave of the future is solar or biodiesel or ethanol, there are lists of companies you can sort through and find things that interest you.  Pick a few, count them on fingers on your hands, and you read their annual reports and check the news on their websites and personally share their prospects.  Space out your money, peel off a piece of your savings for these investments.  You can use sharebuilder or scottrade and do it cheaply.  But be patient and don&#039;t be greedy.
        </p> Below is an URL that is a good place to <br>
get an education on the market. <br>
Learn as much as you can first, for free. <br>
 <br>
ScotTrade is only 7 dollars a trade. <br>
 <br>
Have fun.
