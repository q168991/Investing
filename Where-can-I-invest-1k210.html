</script><p> To Start Investing                                                                         <br>
It takes a long time to learn the stock market and it would help if you read some books from your library and information online. It would also help if you did some practice trading with play money. You can do this by using a watch list in Yahoo Finance &gt; My Portfolio. Just pretend you bought some shares of your choice. If you need help to set-up the watch list, let me know. <br>
 <br>
No one can tell what you should invest in the market. You need to decide what&#039;s right for you at the present time. Before you start investing, the first thing you need to decide is what risk level you want to take.  CDs backed up by the government has about 3-4% annual return for the long term with a low risk.  Bonds or Bonds Funds has about 5-7% annual return for the long term with a medium risk.  Stocks or Stock Mutual Funds has about 8-10% annual return for the long term with a high risk and are more volatile than Bonds. A person could make more than 10% annual return with the right investment. Usually the more risk you take, the more return you will have, but not always. The stock market is basally made up of stocks and bonds. Investment managers pick a group of stocks to make a mutual fund or a group of bonds to make a bond fund.  They even put a mixture of stocks and bonds together and call it a Growth &amp; Income Fund.   <br>
  <br>
1- MUTUAL FUNDS: Mutual funds have a group of stocks (could be around 100+) invested in different sectors, and manage by a professional. Managers have lots of schooling for investing in stocks, around 8 years. So I think managers can pick stocks better than I can. There are lots of different kinds of mutual funds and they have different risk level. There are 100s of funds that does not charge any fees to buy it&#039;s shares and they are called Noload Funds. There are also some funds called Load Funds that charge about 5% of your investment. You can make a buy or sell order anytime of the day for mutual funds shares but it will not go in affect until the close of the day. Most funds has trading restriction and you may not be able to trade more than 4 times a year. That&#039;s because it makes it hard for the fund to make a good return if there is to much trading in the fund, causing the fund manager to make more buys and sells and keep more cash on hand. Mutual funds are meant for long term investors. <br>
2- STOCKS: Stocks is more volatile than funds unless you spread you money in several different areas and know witch area will do best. There are 10 stock sectors and over 100 sub-sectors to choose from. Stock trading restriction is only a few days, not like mutual funds. If you own stocks, you will need to keep up with all the company&#039;s business so you don&#039;t get stuck with a bad stock. That could take a lots of time. If a person buys just a few stocks he probably is hoping to make a bigger return but he may be taking more risk. If that&#039;s the case, look at the leverage ETFs that represents a large group of stocks. That could be another choice.   <br>
3- ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds): ETFs are like a mutual fund but trades like a stock and that is the main differences between ETFs and stocks and mutual funds. There are some ETFs that represents Index&#039;s. An Index is like S&amp;P or DOW. Index&#039;s operate just like a mutual fund with a group of stocks in deferent sectors, manage by professionals. You can&#039;t buy Index&#039;s because they are not for sell.  A company owns them.  But you can buy a mutual funds or an ETF that has the same stocks as the Index they represent. There are a lots of different kinds of ETFs for someone to choose from. There are some that represent almost every kind of sub-sector.  And there are some that have 1x leverage, some have 2x leverage for aggressive investors, and some has 3x leverage for more aggressive investors. The 3x is like having three times the amount of your money in the market. You will make more in an up market but lose more in a down market.  <br>
 <br>
To buy stocks or funds, you need a broker account. You can open an account online and it is free. You can find several good brokers that charge $8.00 and under per stock trade and no fee on Noload Funds. Most broker websites have good research tools. Some popular broker websites are Fidelity, TD Ameritrade, E-trade, Scottrade and others.  I think you need a min. of $500 (some sites $2,500) to open a broker account and need to be at lease 18 years old. If you not 18, you might could get your Dad to open an account for you.

</script><p> Hi , <br>
 <br>
The stock market can be confusing and trading can seem to be hit and miss like gambling.  there are many people who lose money but there are a FEW WHO  make a lot of money.  I know that no matter what happens to the economy you can still make money trading in the stock market as it is about buying and selling stocks and options.  Everything goes up or it goes down.   <br>
 <br>
The only way to make consistent and regular money is with a proven system and business model which I have begun to use and implement with great success. <br>
 <br>
Find out how to win  consistently month after month. <br>
 <br>
If you want the same then make sure you watch the video by using the link in the source box and see for yourself. <br>
 <br>
I am glad I did and know you will as well. <br>
 <br>
Good luck and success for you.
        </p> NOOOO!!! DO not invest 1K in stocks. Absolutely not. You will lose your money faster than you can say the word stock. Here&#039;s why: The commision fees that you will be charged will require you to make at least 30% increase per stock that you purchase. After all, placing all of $1K into oen stock is way too risky unless its a sure thing,. Your best bet is to purcahse a mutual fund that ou&#039;ve researched. This way, they do the work for you. Otherwise, wait till you have at least $5-10K. Then you will be well off into financial freedom.
        </p> My very first investment. <br>
An ETF called SPY <br>
http://finance.yahoo***/q?s=SPY <br>
It holds companies such as Exxon, Apple, P&amp;G <br>
It is designed to follow the S&amp;P 500. <br>
It does not fluctuate as much as individual stocks. <br>
 <br>
Note:  A good discount broker may require $1,500 to $3,000 minimum to open an account <br>
Choose the best if you can.  Such as schwab or fidelity. <br>
High rate cd&#039;s will have to be LONG term cd&#039;s. <br>
And at your age I would not tie up the money for the long term since you might need it in the future. <br>
 <br>
Note:  With $1,000 even if the market goes up 10% a year this is just $100. <br>
It&#039;s not going to allow you to really have an income you can use...
        </p> The S&amp;P 500 is projected to do well this year (so far it is up over 4% this year), so you could put it into an S&amp;P 500 index fund...if you want a specific stock to look at consider netflix, or chipolte&#039;s or BHP billiton (symbol BHP)...they have done well for me....CD&#039;s are not paying much and bonds are even worse.
        </p> Why not invest in yourself, you know what you are capable of. I certainly would not gamble, that will get you in debt. Try some kind of marketing, you obviously have a computer use it. Just have a littel dab into article marketing it certainly will not cost 1K to set up more like £50  in total incl web site and hosting.
        </p>
