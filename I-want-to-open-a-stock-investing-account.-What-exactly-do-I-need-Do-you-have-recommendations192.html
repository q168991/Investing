 <br>
If you are looking for brokers then here&#039;s a couple: <br>
1) AmeriTrade <br>
2) Etrade <br>
3) ScottTrade <br>
 <br>
I highly recommend AmeriTrade they are really amazing, but see if the rest fit your needs. I also recommend that you know what you&#039;re doing before you make investment decisions because i got burnt making very stupid decisions. It&#039;s a lot better now after I started learning more about how the marktets work. <br>
 <br>
Good luck and make some money :)
